PROPERTIES: 
Also, number of nonisomorphic subgroups of order n in symmetric group S_n. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Dec 16 2004
Also, number of nonisomorphic primitives of the combinatorial species Lin[n-1]. - _Nicolae Boicu_, Apr 29 2011
The record values are (A046058): 1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 51, 52, 267, 2328, 56092, 10494213, 49487365422, ..., and they appear at positions (A046059): 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, .... _Robert G. Wilson v_, Oct 12 2012
In (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008), a(n) is called the "group number of n", denoted by gnu(n), and the first occurrence of k is called the "minimal order attaining k", denoted by moa(k) (see A046057). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 15 2017
It is conjectured in (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008) that the sequence n -> a(n) -> a(a(n)) = a^2(n) -> a(a(a(n))) = a^3(n) -> ... -> consists ultimately of 1s, where a(n), denoted by gnu(n), is called the "group number of n". - _Muniru A Asiru_, Nov 19 2017


NAME: Kolakoski sequence: a(n) is length of n-th run; a(1) = 1; sequence consists just of 1's and 2's.
SEQUENCE: 1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,2
PROPERTIES: 
Historical note: the sequence might be better called the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence, since it was discussed by Rufus Oldenburger in 1939; see links. - _Clark Kimberling_, Dec 06 2012.  However, to avoid confusion, this sequence will be known in the OEIS as the Kolakoski sequence. It is undesirable to have some entries refer to the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence and others to the Kolakoski sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 22 2017
It is an unsolved problem to show that the density of 1's is equal to 1/2.
A weaker problem is to construct a combinatorial bijection between the set of positions of 1's and the set of positions of 2's. - _Gus Wiseman_, Mar 01 2016
The sequence is cubefree and all square subwords have lengths which are one of 2, 4, 6, 18 and 54 (see A294447) [Carpi, 1994].
This is a fractal sequence: replace each run with its length and recover the original sequence. - _Kerry Mitchell_, Dec 08 2005
Kupin and Rowland write: We use a method of Goulden and Jackson to bound freq_1(K), the limiting frequency of 1 in the Kolakoski word K. We prove that |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 17/762, assuming the limit exists and establish the semirigorous bound |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 1/46. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 16 2008
freq_1(K) is conjectured to be 1/2 + O(log(K)) (see PlanetMath link). - _Jon Perry_, Oct 29 2014
Conjecture: Taking the sequence in word lengths of 10, for example, batch 1-10, 11-20, etc., then there can only be 4, 5 or 6 1's in each batch. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 26 2012
From _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 04 2014: (Start)
The sequence does not contain words of the form ababa, because this would imply the impossible 111 (1 b, 1 a, 1 b) somewhere before. This demonstrates the conjecture made by _Jon Perry_: more than 6 1's or 6 2's in a word of 10 would necessitate something like aabaabaaba, which would imply the impossible 12121 before (word aabaababaa is also impossible because of ababa). The remark on the sextuplets below even shows that the number of 1's in any 9-tuplet is always 4 or 5.
There are only 6 triples that appear in the sequence (112, 121, 122, 211, 212 and 221); and by the preceding argument, only 18 sextuplets: the 6 double triples (112112, etc.); 112122, 112212, 121122, 121221, 211212, and 211221; and those obtained by reversing the order of the triples (122112, etc.). Regarding the density of 1's in the sequence, these 12 sextuplets all have a density 1/2 of 1's, and the 6 double triples all lead to a word with this exact density after transformation by the Kolakoski rules, for example: 112112 -> 12112122 (4 1's/8); this is because the second triple reverses the numbers of 1's and 2's generated by the first triple. Therefore, the sequence can be split into the double triples on one side, a part whose transformation (which is in the sequence) has a density of 1's of 1/2; and a part with the other sextuplets, which has directly the same density of 1's. (End)
If we map 1 to +1 and 2 to -1, then the mapped sequence would have a [conjectured] mean of 0, since the Kolakoski sequence is [conjectured] to have an equal density (1/2) of 1s and 2s. For the partial sums of this mapped sequence, see A088568. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 08 2015
Looking at the plot for A088568, it seems that although the asymptotic densities of 1s and 2s appear to be 1/2, there might be a bias in favor of the 2s. I.e., D(1) = 1/2 - O(log(n)/n), D(2) = 1/2 + O(log(n)/n). - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 11 2015

(a(n)) is the unique fixed point of the 2-block substitution beta
    11 -> 12
    12 -> 122
    21 -> 112
    22 -> 1122.
A 2-block substitution beta maps a word w(1)...w(2n) to the word
    beta(w(1)w(2))...beta(w(2n-1)w(2n)).
If the word has odd length, then the last letter is ignored.
It was noted by me in 1979 in the Bordeaux seminar on number theory that (a(n+1)) is fixed point of the 2-block substitution 11 -> 21, 12 -> 211, 21 -> 221,  22 -> 2211. (End)

From _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 02 2008: (Start)
It seems that 2*a(n) gives the degree of the minimal polynomial of (k_n)^2 where k_n is the n-th singular value, i.e., K(sqrt(1-k_n^2))/K(k_n)==sqrt(n) (and K is the elliptic integral of the first kind: K(x) := hypergeom([1/2,1/2],[1], x^2)).
Also, when setting K3(x)=hypergeom([1/3,2/3],[1], x^3) and solving for x such that K3((1-x^3)^(1/3))/K3(x)==sqrt(n), then the degree of the minimal polynomial of x^3 is every third term of this sequence, or so it seems. (End)

NAME: d(n) (also called tau(n) or sigma_0(n)), the number of divisors of n.
SEQUENCE: 1,2,2,3,2,4,2,4,3,4,2,6,2,4,4,5,2,6,2,6,4,4,2,8,3,4,4,6,2,8,2,6,4,4,4,9,2,4,4,8,2,8,2,6,6,4,2,10,3,6,4,6,2,8,4,8,4,4,2,12,2,4,6,7,4,8,2,6,4,8,2,12,2,4,6,6,4,8,2,10,5,4,2,12,4,4,4,8,2,12,4,6,4,4,4,12,2,6,6,9,2,8,2,8
PROPERTIES: 
If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is Product p^e(p) then d(n) = Product (e(p) + 1). More generally, for k>0, sigma_k(n) = Product_p ((p^((e(p)+1)*k))-1)/(p^k-1) is the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n.
Number of ways to write n as n = x*y, 1 <= x <= n, 1 <= y <= n. For number of unordered solutions to x*y=n, see A038548.
Note that d(n) is not the number of Pythagorean triangles with radius of the inscribed circle equal to n (that is A078644). For number of primitive Pythagorean triangles having inradius n, see A068068(n).
Number of factors in the factorization of the polynomial x^n-1 over the integers. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 16 2003
Also equal to the number of partitions p of n such that all the parts have the same cardinality, i.e. max(p)=min(p). - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 06 2006
Equals A127093 as an infinite lower triangular matrix * the harmonic series, [1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...]. - _Gary W. Adamson_, May 10 2007
Sum_{n>0} d(n)/(n^n) = Sum_{n>0, m>0} 1/(n*m). - _Gerald McGarvey_, Dec 15 2007
For odd n, this is the number of partitions of n into consecutive integers. Proof: For n = 1, clearly true. For n = 2k + 1, k >= 1, map each (necessarily odd) divisor to such a partition as follows: For 1 and n, map k + (k+1) and n, respectively. For any remaining divisor d <= sqrt(n), map (n/d - (d-1)/2) + ... + (n/d - 1) + (n/d) + (n/d + 1) + ... + (n/d + (d-1)/2) {i.e., n/d plus (d-1)/2 pairs each summing to 2n/d}. For any remaining divisor d > sqrt(n), map ((d-1)/2 - (n/d - 1)) + ... + ((d-1)/2 - 1) + (d-1)/2 + (d+1)/2 + ((d+1)/2 + 1) + ... + ((d+1)/2 + (n/d - 1)) {i.e., n/d pairs each summing to d}. As all such partitions must be of one of the above forms, the 1-to-1 correspondence and proof is complete. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 20 2008

Example: a(6) = 4 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2) dot (2, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1) = (2, -1, 0, -2, 3, 2) = 4. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 26 2009

Conjecture: No two successive terms in the sequence differ by more than 1. Proof of this would prove the converse of the theorem that every prime is surrounded by two consecutive squares, namely |sqrt(p)|^2 and (|sqrt(p)|+1)^2. - _Cino Hilliard_, Jan 22 2003
Equals the number of squares less than prime(n). Cf. A014689. - _Zak Seidov_ Nov 04 2007
The above conjecture is Legendre's conjecture that for n > 0 there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2. See A014085, number of primes between two consecutive squares, which is also the number of times n is repeated in the present sequence. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 25 2013

The number of maximal self-avoiding walks from the NW to SW corners of a 1 X n grid. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Nov 19 2010
Historically there has been some disagreement as to whether 0^0 = 1. Graphing x^0 seems to support that conclusion, but graphing 0^x instead suggests that 0^0 = 0. Euler and Knuth have argued in favor of 0^0 = 1. For some calculators, 0^0 triggers an error, while in Mathematica, 0^0 is Indeterminate. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 15 2011
Another consequence of changing the offset to 1 is that then this sequence can be described as the sum of Moebius mu(d) for the divisors d of n. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 28 2011

PROPERTIES: 
Definition (2): Equivalently, number of different output sequences from an n-stage pure cycling shift register when 2 sequences are considered the same if one is the complement of the other.
Definition (3): Also number of different output sequences from an n-stage pure cycling shift register constrained so contents have even weight.
Definition (4): Also number of output sequences from (n-1)-stage shift register which feeds back the mod 2 sum of the contents of the register.
The equivalence of definitions (1) and (2) follows at once from the definitions.
If u is an output sequence of type (2) then its derivative is of type (3) - so (2) and (3) count the same things.
If we have a shift register of type (4), append a new cell which contains the mod 2 sum of the contents to get a shift register of type (3). So (3) and (4) count the same things.

NAME: The positive integers. Also called the natural numbers, the whole numbers or the counting numbers, but these terms are ambiguous.
SEQUENCE: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77
PROPERTIES: 
For some authors, the terms "natural numbers" and "counting numbers" include 0, i.e., refer to the nonnegative integers A001477; the term "whole numbers" frequently also designates the whole set of (signed) integers A001057.
a(n) is smallest positive integer which is consistent with sequence being monotonically increasing and satisfying a(a(n)) = n (cf. A007378).

Numbers of form (2^i)*k for odd k (i.e., n = A006519(n)*A000265(n)); thus n corresponds uniquely to an ordered pair (i,k) where i=A007814, k=A000265 (with A007814(2n)=A001511(n), A007814(2n+1)=0). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Apr 22 2006
If the offset were changed to 0, we would have the following pattern: a(n)=binomial(n,0) + binomial(n,1) for the present sequence (number of regions in 1-space defined by n points), A000124 (number of regions in 2-space defined by n straight lines), A000125 (number of regions in 3-space defined by n planes), A000127 (number of regions in 4-space defined by n hyperplanes), A006261, A008859, A008860, A008861, A008862 and A008863, where the last six sequences are interpreted analogously and in each "... by n ..." clause an offset of 0 has been assumed, resulting in a(0)=1 for all of them, which corresponds to the case of not cutting with a hyperplane at all and therefore having one region. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006
Define a number of points on a straight line to be in general arrangement when no two points coincide. Then these are the numbers of regions defined by n points in general arrangement on a straight line, when an offset of 0 is assumed. For instance, a(0)=1, since using no point at all leaves one region. The sequence satisfies the recursion a(n) = a(n-1) + 1. This has the following geometrical interpretation: Suppose there are already n-1 points in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions on a straight line obtainable by n-1 points, and now one more point is added in general arrangement. Then it will coincide with no other point and act as a dividing wall thereby creating one new region in addition to the a(n-1)=(n-1)+1=n regions already there, hence a(n)=a(n-1)+1. Cf. the comments on A000124 for an analogous interpretation. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006

"God made the integers; all else is the work of man."

Writing A000027 as N, perhaps the simplest one-to-one correspondence between N X N and N is this: f(m,n) = ((m+n)^2 - m - 3n + 2)/2. Its inverse is given by I(k)=(g,h), where g = k - J(J-1)/2, h = J + 1 - g, J = floor((1 + sqrt(8k - 7))/2). Thus I(1)=(1,1), I(2)=(1,2), I(3)=(2,1) and so on; the mapping I fills the first-quadrant lattice by successive antidiagonals. - _Clark Kimberling_, Sep 11 2008

Triangle T(k,j) of natural numbers, read by rows, with T(k,j) = binomial(k,2) + j = (k^2-k)/2 + j where 1<=j<=k. In other words, a(n) = n = binomial(k,2) + j where k is the largest integer such that binomial(k,2) < n and j = n - binomial(k,2). For example, T(4,1)=7, T(4,2)=8, T(4,3)=9, and T(4,4)=10.

Suppose psi = log(phi). We get the representation L(n) = 2*cosh(n*psi) if n is even; L(n) = 2*sinh(n*psi) if n is odd. There is a similar representation for Fibonacci numbers (A000045). Many Lucas formulas now easily follow from appropriate sinh- and cosh-formulas. For example: the identity cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1 implies L(n)^2 - 5F(n)^2 = 4*(-1)^n (setting x = n*psi). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Apr 18 2007
From _John Blythe Dobson_, Oct 02 2007, Oct 11 2007: (Start)
The parity of L(n) follows easily from its definition, which shows that L(n) is even when n is a multiple of 3 and odd otherwise.
The first six multiplication formulas are:
L(2n) = L(n)^2 - 2*(-1)^n;
L(3n) = L(n)^3 - 3*(-1)^n*L(n);
L(4n) = L(n)^4 - 4*(-1)^n*L(n)^2 + 2;
L(5n) = L(n)^5 - 5*(-1)^n*L(n)^3 + 5*L(n);
L(6n) = L(n)^6 - 6*(-1)^n*L(n)^4 + 9*L(n)^2 - 2*(-1)^n.
Generally, L(n) | L(mn) if and only if m is odd.
In the expansion of L(mn), where m represents the multiplier and n the index of a known value of L(n), the absolute values of the coefficients are the terms in the m-th row of the triangle A034807. When m = 1 and n = 1, L(n) = 1 and all the terms are positive and so the row sums of A034807 are simply the Lucas numbers. (End)
From _John Blythe Dobson_, Nov 15 2007: (Start)
The comments submitted by Miklos Kristof on Mar 19 2007 for the Fibonacci numbers (A000045) contain four important identities that have close analogs in the Lucas numbers:
For a >= b and odd  b, L(a + b) + L(a - b) = 5*F(a)*F(b).
For a >= b and even b, L(a + b) + L(a - b) = L(a)*L(b).
For a >= b and odd  b, L(a + b) - L(a - b) = L(a)*L(b).
For a >= b and even b, L(a + b) - L(a - b) = 5*F(a)*F(b).
A particularly interesting instance of the difference identity for even b is L(a + 30) - L(a - 30) = 5*F(a)*832040, since 5*832040 is divisible by 100, proving that the last two digits of Lucas numbers repeat in a cycle of length 60 (see A106291(100)). (End)
From _John Blythe Dobson_, Nov 15 2007: (Start)
The Lucas numbers satisfy remarkable difference equations, in some cases best expressed using Fibonacci numbers, of which representative examples are the following:
L(n) - L(n - 3)  = 2*L(n - 2);
L(n) - L(n - 4)  = 5*F(n - 2);
L(n) - L(n - 6)  = 4*L(n - 3);
L(n) - L(n - 12) = 40*F(n - 6);
L(n) - L(n - 60) = 4160200*F(n - 30).
These formulas establish, respectively, that the Lucas numbers form a cyclic residue system of length 3 (mod 2), of length 4 (mod 5), of length 6 (mod 4), of length 12 (mod 40) and of length 60 (mod 4160200). The divisibility of the last modulus by 100 accounts for the fact that the last two digits of the Lucas numbers begin to repeat at L(60).
The divisibility properties of the Lucas numbers are very complex and still not fully understood, but several important criteria are established in Zhi-Hong Sun's 2003 survey of congruences for Fibonacci numbers. (End)

The same transformation applied to all sequences of the form G(n+1) = m * G(n) + G(n-1) yields Lucas numbers for m = 1, except where G(j) = 0,  regardless of initial values which may be nonintegers. The corresponding sequences for other values of m are: for m = 2, 2*A001333;   for m = 3, A006497;   for m = 4, 2*A001077;  for m = 5, A087130;   for m = 6, 2*A005667;  for m = 7, A086902. The invariant ones all have G(0) = 2, G(1) = m. A related family of sequences is discussed at A059100. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Nov 23 2014
If x=a(n), y=a(n+1), z=a(n+2), then -x^2 - z*x - 3*y*x - y^2 + y*z + z^2 = 5*(-1)^(n+1). - _Alexander Samokrutov_, Jul 04 2015

A trapezoid has three lengths of sides in order L(n-1), L(n+1), L(n-1). For increasing n a very close approximation to the maximum area will have the fourth side equal to 2*L(n).  For a trapezoid with sides L(n-1), L(n-3), L(n-1), the fourth side will be L(n). - _J. M. Bergot_, Mar 17 2016

Lucas numbers L(n) and Fibonacci numbers F(n), being related by the formulas F(n) = (F(n-1) + L(n-1))/2 and L(n) = 2 F(n+1) - F(n), are a typical pair of "autosequences" (see the link to OEIS Wiki). - _Jean-François Alcover_, Jun 09 2017

A number n is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors except 1 and n.
A natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly two (positive) divisors.
A prime has exactly one proper positive divisor, 1.
The paper by Kaoru Motose starts as follows: "Let q be a prime divisor of a Mersenne number 2^p-1 where p is prime. Then p is the order of 2 (mod q). Thus p is a divisor of q - 1 and q > p. This shows that there exist infinitely many prime numbers." - Pieter Moree, Oct 14 2004
1 is not a prime, for if the primes included 1, then the factorization of a natural number n into a product of primes would not be unique, since n = n*1.
Prime(n) and pi(n) are inverse functions: A000720(a(n)) = n and a(n) is the least number m such that a(A000720(m)) = a(n). a(A000720(n)) = n if (and only if) n is prime.

A number n is prime if and only if it is different from zero and different from a unit and each multiple of n decomposes into factors such that n divides at least one of the factors. This applies equally to the integers (where a prime has exactly four divisors (the definition of divisors is relaxed such that they can be negative)) and the positive integers (where a prime has exactly two distinct divisors). - _Peter Luschny_, Oct 09 2012
Motivated by his conjecture on representations of integers by alternating sums of consecutive primes, for any positive integer n, Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that the polynomial P_n(x)= sum_{k=0}^n a(k+1)*x^k is irreducible over the field of rational numbers with the Galois group S_n, and moreover P_n(x) is irreducible mod a(m) for some m<=n(n+1)/2. It seems that no known criterion on irreduciblity of polynomials implies this conjecture. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Mar 23 2013

I conjecture that for any positive rational number r there are finitely many primes q_1,...,q_k such that r = Sum_{j=1..k} 1/(q_j-1). For example, 2 = 1/(2-1)+1/(3-1)+1/(5-1)+1/(7-1)+1/(13-1) with 2, 3, 5, 7 and 13 all prime, 1/7 = 1/(13-1)+1/(29-1)+1/(43-1) with 13, 29 and 43 all prime, and 5/7 = 1/(3-1)+1/(7-1)+1/(31-1)+1/(71-1) with 3, 7, 31 and 71 all prime. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Sep 09 2015

Let P(z) := Sum_{j>=0} b_j z^j, b_0 != 0. Then 1/P(z) = Sum_{j>=0} c_j z^j, where the c_j must be computed from the infinite triangular system b_0 c_0 = 1, b_0 c_1 + b_1 c_0 = 0 and so on (Cauchy products of the coefficients set to zero). The n-th partition number arises as the number of terms in the numerator of the expression for c_n: The coefficient c_n of the inverted power series is a fraction with b_0^(n+1) in the denominator and in its numerator having a(n) products of n coefficients b_i each. The partitions may be read off from the indices of the b_i. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Apr 09 2007

This is equivalent to lim_{n=1..inf} A145006^n as a vector. The INVERT transform of (1, 1, 0, 0, -1, ...) begins (1, 2,..) then for each successive operation we take a dot product of (1, 1, 0, 0, -1, ...) in reverse and the ongoing results of our series (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ...) then add the result to the next term in (1, 1, 0, 0, -1, ...).

A sequence of positive integers p = p_1 ... p_k is a descending partition of the positive integer n if p_1 + ... + p_k = n and p_1 >= ... >= p_k. If formally needed p_j = 0 is appended to p for j > k. Let P_n denote the set of these partition for some n >= 1. Then a(n) = 1 + Sum_{p in P_n} floor((p_1-1)/(p_2+1)). (Cf. A000065, where the formula reduces to the sum.) Proof in Kelleher and O'Sullivan (2009). For example a(6) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11. - _Peter Luschny_, Oct 24 2010

Let k > 0 be an integer, and let i_1, i_2, ..., i_k be distinct integers such that 1 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k. Then, equivalently, a(n) equals the number of partitions of N = n + i_1 + i_2 + ... + i_k in which each i_j (1 <= j <= k) appears as a part at least once. To see this, note that the partitions of N of this class must be in 1-to-1 correspondence with the partitions of n, since N - i_1 - i_2 - ... - i_k = n. - _L. Edson Jeffery_, Apr 16 2011
a(n) is the number of distinct degree sequences over all free trees having n + 2 nodes.  Take a partition of the integer n, add 1 to each part and append as many 1's as needed so that the total is 2n + 2.  Now we have a degree sequence of a tree with n + 2 nodes.  Example: The partition 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 corresponds to the degree sequence {4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} of a tree with 8 vertices. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Apr 16 2011

Partitions of n that contain a part p are the partitions of n - p. Thus, number of partitions of m*n - r that include k*n as a part is A000041(h*n-r), where h = m - k >= 0, n >= 2, 0 <= r < n; see A111295 as an example.  - _Clark Kimberling_, Mar 03 2014

Define a segmented partition a(n,k, <s(1)..s(j)>) to be a partition of n with exactly k parts, with s(j) parts t(j) identical to each other and distinct from all the other parts. Note that n >= k, j <= k, 0 <= s(j) <= k, s(1)t(1) + ... + s(j)t(j) = n and s(1) + ... + s(j) = k. Then there are up to a(k) segmented partitions of n with exactly k parts. - _Gregory L.

From _Gregory L. Simay_, Nov 09 2015: (Start)
The polynomials for a(n, k, <s(1), ..., s(j)>) have degree j-1.
  a(n, k, <k>) = 1 if n = 0 mod k, = 0 otherwise
  a(rn, rk, <r*s(1), ..., r*s(j)>) = a(n, k, <s(1), ..., s(j)>)
  a(n odd, k, <all s(j) even>) = 0
Established results can be recast in terms of segmented partitions:
  For j(j+1)/2 <= n < (j+1)(j+2)/2, A000009(n) = a(n, 1, <1>) + ... + a(n, j, <j 1's>), j < n

Number of compositions of n into parts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. - _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 05 2014
If a(0) = 1 then it is not clear why a(2) = 1, it should be equal to a(1) + a(0) = 2. Does the first comment mean that a(0) is erroneous and should read a(0) = 0? In contrast to A107358, the term a(13) = 232 = 144 + 89 - 1 seems correct, since in this month the first and oldest pair of rabbits die. But a(14) should be equal to a(13) + a(12) = 232 + 144 because the first pair (which was also the only one present in month 2) has already died and there is no other pair aged 12 months. In general, the number of pairs which die in month n because they are aged exactly 12 months, equals a(n-14): this is the number of newborn pairs in month n - 12, viz. a(n-12) = a(n-13) [those from preceding month] + a(n-14) [the newborn ones] - #(those which die). - _M.

It appears that for n >= 2, all first differences are congruent to 0 (mod 4). - _Christopher Hohl_, Dec 28 2018
The comment above is equivalent to a(n) == 3 (mod 4) for n >= 2. This is indeed correct. Actually it can be proved that a(n) == 3, 7 (mod 20) for n >= 2. Let p != 2, 5 be a prime, then: A001175(p) divides (p - 1)/2 if p == 1, 9 (mod 20); p - 1 if p == 11, 19 (mod 20); (p + 1)/2 if p == 13, 17 (mod 20). So the remaining cases are p == 3, 7 (mod 20). - _Jianing Song_, Dec 29 2018

Another version of this sequence is given by A129871, which starts with 1, 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ... .
The greedy Egyptian representation of 1 is 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + 1/1807 + ... .
Take a square. Divide it into 2 equal rectangles by drawing a horizontal line. Divide the upper rectangle into 2 squares. Now you can divide the lower one into another 2 squares, but instead of doing so draw a horizontal line below the first one so you obtain a (2+1 = 3) X 1 rectangle which can be divided in 3 squares. Now you have a 6 X 1 rectangle at the bottom. Instead of dividing it into 6 squares, draw another horizontal line so you obtain a (6+1 = 7) X 1 rectangle and a 42 X 1 rectangle left, etc. - _Néstor Romeral Andrés_, Oct 29 2001
More generally one may define f(1) = x_1, f(2) = x_2, ..., f(k) = x_k, f(n) = f(1)*...*f(n-1)+1 for n > k and natural numbers x_i (i = 1, ..., k) which satisfy gcd(x_i, x_j) = 1 for i <> j. By definition of the sequence we have that for each pair of numbers x, y from the sequence gcd(x, y) = 1. An interesting property of a(n) is that for n >= 2, 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) + ... + 1/a(n-1) = (a(n)-2)/(a(n)-1). Thus we can also write a(n) = (1/a(1) + 1/a(2) + ... + 1/a(n-1) - 2 )/( 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) + ... + 1/a(n-1) - 1). - Frederick Magata (frederick.magata(AT)uni-muenster.de), May 10 2001
A greedy sequence: a(n+1) is the smallest integer > a(n) such that 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) + ... + 1/a(n+1) doesn't exceed 1. The sequence gives infinitely many ways of writing 1 as the sum of Egyptian fractions: Cut the sequence anywhere and decrement the last element. 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + 1/1806 = ... . - Ulrich Schimke, Nov 17 2002
Consider the mapping f(a/b) = (a^3 + b)/(a + b^3). Starting with a = 1, b = 2 and carrying out this mapping repeatedly on each new (reduced) rational number gives 1/2, 1/3, 4/28 = 1/7, 8/344 = 1/43, ..., i.e., 1/2, 1/3, 1/7, 1/43, 1/1807, ... . Sequence contains the denominators. Also the sum of the series converges to 1. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Mar 22 2003
a(1) = 2, then the smallest number == 1 (mod all previous terms). a(2n+6) == 443 (mod 1000) and a(2n+7) == 807 (mod 1000). - _Amarnath Murthy_, Sep 24 2003
An infinite coprime sequence defined by recursion.
Apart from the initial 2, a subsequence of A002061. It follows that no term is a square.
It appears that a(k)^2 + 1 divides a(k+1)^2 + 1. - _David W. Wilson_, May 30 2004. This is true since a(k+1)^2 + 1 = (a(k)^2 - a(k) + 1)^2 +1 = (a(k)^2-2*a(k)+2)*(a(k)^2 + 1) (a(k+1)=a(k)^2-a(k)+1 by definition). - Pab Ter (pabrlos(AT)yahoo.com), May 31 2004
In general, for any m > 0 coprime to a(0), the sequence a(n+1) = a(n)^2 - ma(n) + m is infinite coprime (Mohanty). This sequence has (m,a(0))=(1,2); (2,3) is A000215; (1,4) is A082732; (3,4) is A000289; (4,5) is A000324.
Any prime factor of a(n) has -3 as its quadratic residue (Granville, exercise 1.2.3c in Pollack).
Note that values need not be prime, the first composites being 1807 = 13 * 139 and 10650056950807 = 547 * 19569939581. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Aug 03 2008
If one takes any subset of the sequence comprising the reciprocals of the first n terms, with the condition that the first term is negated, then this subset has the property that the sum of its elements equals the product of its elements. Thus -1/2 = -1/2, -1/2 + 1/3 = -1/2 * 1/3, -1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 = -1/2 * 1/3 * 1/7, -1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 = -1/2 * 1/3 * 1/7 * 1/43, and so on. - Nick McClendon, May 14 2009
Apart the first term which is 2 we can easily prove that the number of units of a(n) is 3 or 7 alternately. - Mohamed Bouhamida (bhmd95(AT)yahoo.fr), Sep 01 2009
(a(n) + a(n+1)) divides a(n)*a(n+1)-1 because a(n)*a(n+1) - 1 = a(n)*(a(n)^2 - a(n) + 1) - 1 = a(n)^3 - a(n)^2 + a(n) - 1 = (a(n)^2 + 1)*(a(n) - 1) = (a(n) + a(n)^2 - a(n) + 1)*(a(n) - 1) = (a(n) + a(n+1))*(a(n) - 1). - Mohamed Bouhamida (bhmd95(AT)yahoo.fr), Aug 29 2009
This sequence is also related to the short side (or hypotenuse) of adjacent right triangles, (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (13, 84, 85), ... by A053630(n) = 2*a(n) - 1. - _Yuksel Yildirim_, Jan 01 2013, edited by _M. F. Hasler_, May 19 2017
For n >= 4, a(n) mod 3000 alternates between 1807 and 2443. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 18 2015
The set of prime factors of a(n)'s is thin in the set of primes. Indeed, Odoni showed that the number of primes below x dividing some a(n) is O(x/(log x log log log x)). - _Tomohiro Yamada_, Jun 25 2018

Also the total number of all different integers in all partitions of n + 1. E.g., a(3)=7 because the partition of 4 comprises the sets {1},{1, 2},{2},{1, 3},{4} of different integers and their total number is 7. - _Thomas Wieder_, Apr 10 2004
With offset 1, also the number of 1's in all partitions of n. For example, 3 = 2+1 = 1+1+1, a(3) = (zero 1's) + (one 1's) + (three 1's), so a(3) = 4. - _Naohiro Nomoto_, Jan 09 2002. See the Riordan reference p. 184, last formula, first term, for a proof based on Fine's identity given in Riordan, p. 182 (20).
Also, number of partitions of n into parts when there are two kinds of parts of size one.
Also number of graphical forest partitions of 2n+2.
a(n) = count 2 for each partition of n and 1 for each decrement. E.g., the partitions of 4 are 4 (2), 31 (3), 22 (2), 211 (3) and 1111 (2). 2+3+2+3+2=12. This is related to the Ferrers representation. We can see that taking the Ferrers diagram for each partition of n and adding a new * to all available columns, we generate each partition of n+1, but with repeats (A058884). - _Jon Perry_, Feb 06 2004
Also the number of 1-transitions among all integer partitions of n. A 1-transition is the removal of a digit "1" from a partition containing at least one "1" and subsequent addition of that "1" to another digit in that partition. This other digit may be a "1" also, but all digits of equal amount are considered as undistinquishable (unlabeled). E.g., for n=6 one has the partition [1113] for which the following two 1-transitions are possible: [1113] --> [123] and [1113] --> [114]. The 1-transitions of n form a partial order (poset). For n=6 one has 12 1-transitions: [111111] --> [11112], [11112] --> [1113], [11112] --> [1122], [1113] --> [114], [1113] --> [123], [1122] --> [123], [1122] --> [222], [123] --> [33], [123] --> [24], [114] --> [15], [114] --> [24], [15] --> [6]. - _Thomas Wieder_, Mar 08 2005

Also the total number of 1's among all hook-lengths in all partitions of n. E.g., a(4)=7 because hooks of the partitions of n=4 comprise the multisets {4,3,2,1},{4,2,1,1},{3,2,2,1},{4,1,2,1},{4,3,2,1} and their total number of 1's is 7. - _T. Amdeberhan_, Jun 03 2012
With offset 1, a(n) is also the difference between the sum of largest and the sum of second largest elements in all partitions of n. More generally, the number of occurrences of k in all partitions of n equals the difference between the sum of k-th largest and the sum of (k+1)st largest elements in all partitions of n. And more generally, the sum of the number of occurrences of k, k+1, k+2..k+m in all partitions of n equals the difference between the sum of k-th largest and the sum of (k+m+1)st largest elements in all partitions of n. - _Omar E.

a(n) is also the number of unlabeled subgraphs of the n-cycle C_n. For example, for n = 3, there are 3 unlabeled subgraphs of the triangle C_3 with 0 edges, 2 with 1 edge, 1 with 2 edges, and 1 with 3 edges (C_3 itself), so a(3) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7. - _John P. McSorley_, Nov 21 2016
a(n) is also the number of partitions of 2n with all parts either even or equal to 1. Proof: the number of such partitions of 2n with exactly 2k 1's is p(n-k), for k = 0,..,n. Summing over k gives the formula. - _Leonard Chastkofsky_, Jul 24 2018
a(n) is the total number of polygamma functions that appear in the expansion of the (n+1)st derivative of x! with respect to x. More specifically, a(n) is the number of times the string "PolyGamma" appears in the expansion of D[x!, {x, n + 1}] in Mathematica. For example,  D[x!, {x, 3 + 1}] = Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x]^4 + 6 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x]^2 PolyGamma[1, 1 + x] + 3 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[1, 1 + x]^2 + 4 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x] PolyGamma[2, 1 + x] + Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[3, 1 + x], and we see that the string "PolyGamma" appears a total of a(3) = 7 times in this expansion. - _John M. Campbell_, Aug 11 2018

a(n) is the number of allowable transition rules for passing from one change to the next (on n - 1 bells) in the English art of bell-ringing. This is also the number of involutions in the symmetric group S_{n-1} which can be represented as a product of transpositions of consecutive numbers from {1, 2, ..., n - 1}. Thus for n = 6 we have a(6) from (12), (12)(34), (12)(45), (23), (23)(45), (34), (45), for instance. See my 1983 Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. paper. - Arthur T. White, letter to _N. J. A.

Number of 001-avoiding binary words of length n - 3. a(n) is the number of partitions of {1, ..., n - 1} into two blocks in which only 1- or 2-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block and there is at least one 2-string. E.g., a(6) = 7 because the enumerated partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are 124/35, 134/25, 14/235, 13/245, 1245/3, 145/23, 125/34. - _Augustine O. Munagi_, Apr 11 2005

A Fibonacci tree of order n (n >= 2) is a complete binary tree whose left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n - 1 and whose right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n - 2; each of the Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 is defined as a single node (see the Knuth reference, p. 417). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 14 2010
a(n+3) is the number of distinct three-strand positive braids of length n (cf. Burckel). - _Maxime Bourrigan_, Apr 04 2011

a(n+2) is the number of leafs of great-grandparent DAG (directed acyclic graph) of height n. A great-grandparent DAG of height n is a single node for n = 1; for n > 1 each leaf of ggpDAG(n-1) has two child nodes where pairs of adjacent new nodes are merged into single node if and only if they have disjoint grandparents and same great-grandparent.

From _Russell Jay Hendel_, Mar 15 2015: (Start)
We can establish _Gerald McGarvey_'s conjecture mentioned in the Formula section, however we require n > 4. We need the following 4 prerequisites.
(1) a(n) = F(n) - 1, with {F(n)}_{n >= 1} the Fibonacci numbers A000045. (2) (Binet Form) F(n) = (d^n - e^n)/sqrt(5) with d = phi and e = 1 - phi, de = -1 and d + e = 1. It follows that a(n) = (d(n) - e(n))/sqrt(5) - 1. (3) To prove floor(x) = y is equivalent to proving that x - y lies in the half-open interval [0, 1). (4) The series {s(n) = c1 x^n + c2}_{n >= 1}, with -1 < x < 0, and c1 and c2 positive constants, converges by oscillation with s(1) < s(3) < s(5) < ... < s(6) < s(4) < s(2). If follows that for any odd n, the open interval (s(n), s(n+1)) contains the subsequence {s(t)}_{t >= n + 2}. Using these prerequisites we can analyze the conjecture.
Using prerequisites (2) and (3) we see we must prove, for all n > 4, that d(d^(n-1) - e^(n-1))/sqrt(5) - 1) - (d^n - e^n)/sqrt(5) + 1 + c lies in the interval [0, 1). But de = -1, implying de^(n-1) = -e^(n-2). It follows that we must equivalently prove (for all n > 4) that E(n, c) = (e^(n-2) + e^n)/sqrt(5) + 1 - d + c = e^(n-2) (e^2 + 1)/sqrt(5) + e + c lies in [0, 1). Clearly, for any particular n, E(n, c) has extrema (maxima, minima) when c = 2(1 - d) and c = (1 + d)(1 - d). Therefore, the proof is completed by using prerequisite (4). It suffices to verify E(5, 2(1 - d)) = 0, E(6, 2(1 - d)) = 0.236068, E(5, (1 - d)(1 + d)) = 0.618034, E(6,(1 - d)(1 + d)) = 0.854102, all lie in [0, 1).

2^0 = 1 is the only odd power of 2.
Number of subsets of an n-set.
There are 2^(n-1) compositions (ordered partitions) of n - see for example Riordan. This is the unlabeled analog of the preferential labelings sequence A000670.
This is also the number of weakly unimodal permutations of 1..n+1, that is, permutations with exactly one local maximum. E.g., a(4)=16: 12345, 12354, 12453, 12543, 13452, 13542, 14532 and 15432 and their reversals. - _Jon Perry_, Jul 27 2003. Proof: see next line! See also A087783.
Proof: n must appear somewhere and there are 2^(n-1) possible choices for the subset that precedes it. These must appear in increasing order and the rest must follow n in decreasing order. QED. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 26 2003
a(n+1) = smallest number that is not the sum of any number of (distinct) earlier terms.
Same as Pisot sequences E(1,2), L(1,2), P(1,2), T(1,2). See A008776 for definitions of Pisot sequences.

Least deficient or near-perfect numbers (i.e., n such that sigma(n)=A000203(n)=2n-1). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jun 03 2004. [Comment from _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 26 2005: All the powers of 2 are least deficient numbers but it is not known if there exists a least deficient number that is not a power of 2.]
Almost-perfect numbers referred to as least deficient or slightly defective (Singh 1997) numbers. Does "near-perfect numbers" refer to both almost-perfect numbers (sigma(n) = 2n-1) and quasi-perfect numbers (sigma(n) = 2n+1)? There are no known quasi-perfect or least abundant or slightly excessive (Singh 1997) numbers.
The sum of the numbers in the n-th row of Pascal's triangle; the sum of the coefficients of x in the expansion of (x+1)^n.
The Collatz conjecture (the hailstone sequence will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially) may be restated as (the hailstone sequence will eventually reach a power of 2, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially).
The only hailstone sequence which doesn't rebound (except "on the ground"). - _Alexandre Wajnberg_, Jan 29 2005
With p(n) = the number of integer partitions of n, p(i) = the number of parts of the i-th partition of n, d(i) = the number of different parts of the i-th partition of n, m(i,j) = multiplicity of the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, one has: a(n) = sum_{i=1..p(n)} (p(i)! / (prod_{j=1..d(i)} m(i,j)!)). - _Thomas Wieder_, May 18 2005

a(n) = number of permutations on [n+1] such that every initial segment is an interval of integers. Example: a(3) counts 1234, 2134, 2314, 2341, 3214, 3241, 3421, 4321. The map "p -> ascents of p" is a bijection from these permutations to subsets of [n]. An ascent of a permutation p is a position i such that p(i) < p(i+1). The permutations shown map to 123, 23, 13, 12, 3, 2, 1 and the empty set respectively. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2008

a(n) = the largest number m such that the number of steps of iterations of {r - (largest divisor d < r)} needed to reach 1 starting at r = m is equal to n. Example (a(5) = 32): 32 - 16 = 16; 16 - 8 = 8; 8 - 4 = 4; 4 - 2 = 2; 2 - 1 = 1; number 32 has 5 steps and is the largest such number. See A105017, A064097, A175125. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Feb 15 2010

The mini-sequence b(n) = least number k > 0 such that 2^k ends in n identical digits is given by {1, 18, 39}. The repeating digits are {2, 4, 8} respectively. Note that these are consecutive powers of 2 (2^1, 2^2, 2^3), and these are the only powers of 2 (2^k, k > 0) that are only one digit. Further, this sequence is finite. The number of n-digit endings for a power of 2 with n or more digits id 4*5^(n-1). Thus, for b(4) to exist, one only needs to check exponents up to 4*5^3 = 500. Since b(4) does not exist, it is clear that no other number will exist. - _Derek Orr_, Jun 14 2014
The least number k > 0 such that 2^k ends in n consecutive decreasing digits is a 3-number sequence given by {1, 5, 25}. The consecutive decreasing digits are {2, 32, 432}. There are 100 different 3-digit endings for 2^k. There are no k-values such that 2^k ends in '987', '876', '765', '654', '543', '321', or '210'. The k-values for which 2^k ends in '432' are given by 25 mod 100. For k = 25 + 100*x, the digit immediately before the run of '432' is {4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, ...} for x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}, respectively. Thus, we see the digit before '432' will never be a 5. So, this sequence is complete. - _Derek Orr_, Jul 03 2014

Number of monotone maps f : [0..n] -> [0..n] which are order-increasing (i <= f(i)) and idempotent (f(f(i)) = f(i)). In other words, monads on the n-th ordinal (seen as a posetal category). Any monad f determines a subset of [0..n] that contains n, by considering its set of monad algebras = fixed points { i | f(i) = i }. Conversely, any subset S of [0..n] containing n determines a monad on [0..n], by the function i |-> min { j | i <= j, j in S }. - _Noam Zeilberger_, Dec 11 2016

SEQUENCE: 0,1,1,2,4,9,20,48,115,286,719,1842,4766,12486,32973,87811,235381,634847,1721159,4688676,12826228,35221832,97055181,268282855,743724984,2067174645,5759636510,16083734329,45007066269,126186554308,354426847597
PROPERTIES: 
Also, number of ways of arranging n-1 nonoverlapping circles: e.g., there are 4 ways to arrange 3 circles, as represented by ((O)), (OO), (O)O, OOO, also see example. (Of course the rules here are different from the usual counting parentheses problems - compare A000108, A001190, A001699.) See Sloane's link for a proof and Vogeler's link for illustration of a(7) as arrangement of 6 circles.
Take a string of n x's and insert n-1 ^'s and n-1 pairs of parentheses in all possible legal ways (cf. A003018). Sequence gives number of distinct functions. The single node tree is "x". Making a node f2 a child of f1 represents f1^f2. Since (f1^f2)^f3 is just f1^(f2*f3) we can think of it as f1 raised to both f2 and f3, that is, f1 with f2 and f3 as children. E.g., for n=4 the distinct functions are ((x^x)^x)^x; (x^(x^x))^x; x^((x^x)^x); x^(x^(x^x)). - _W. Edwin Clark_ and _Russ Cox_ Apr 29, 2003; corrected by Keith Briggs (keith.briggs(AT)bt.com), Nov 14 2005

Empirical: a(n) == A001615(n) (mod 3) for all natural numbers n. - _John M. Campbell_, Apr 01 2018
From _Jianing Song_, Jul 03 2018: (Start)
The comment above is true. Since that both a(n) and A001615(n) is multiplicative we just have to verify that for prime powers. Note that A001615(p^e) = (p+1)*p^(e-1). For p == 1 (mod 3), p+1 == 2 (mod 3) so (p+1)*p^(e-1) == 2 (mod 3); for p == 2 (mod 3), p+1 is a multiple of 3 so (p+1)*p^(e-1) == 0 (mod 3). For p = 3, if e = 1 then p+1 == 1 (mod 3); if e > 1 then (p+1)*p^(e-1) == 0 (mod 3).
Equivalently, number of solutions to x^2 + x + 1 == 0 (mod n). (End)

Theorem 2, p. 3, of Yashar Memarian, states "let G be a 4-regular minimal graph on the plane with n attaching points. Then G has at most (n/2)C2 + n vertices if n is even, else 0. This is sharp. For each n, there is a minimal 4-regular graph which achieves this bound." Since xC2 = (1/2)*(x^2) - (1/2)x, the expression (n/2)C2 + n simplifies to (1/8)*(x^2) + (3/4)*x which is n(n+3)/2 for n an even value of x. Hence I'd say: "let G be a 4-regular minimal graph on the plane with n attaching points. Then G has at most A000096(n) = n(n+3)/2 vertices if n is even, else 0. This is sharp." - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Oct 14 2009

Let phi_(D,rho) be the average value of a generic degree D monic polynomial f when evaluated at the roots of the rho-th derivative of f, expressed as a polynomial in the averaged symmetric polynomials in the roots of f. [See the Wojnar et al. link] The "last" term of phi_(D,rho) is a multiple of the product of all roots of f; the coefficient is expressible as a polynomial h_D(N) in N:=D-rho. These polynomials are of the form h_D(N)= ((-1)^D/(D-1)!)*(D-N)*N^chi*g_D(N) where chi = (1 if D is odd, 0 if D is even) and g_D(N) is a monic polynomial of degree (D-2-chi). Then a(n) are the negated coefficients of the next to the highest order term in the polynomials N^chi*g_D(N), starting at D=3. - _Gregory Gerard Wojnar_, Jul 19 2017

lim_{n->oo} a(n)^(1/n) = mu with 3.98 < mu < 4.64 (quoted by Castiglione et al., with a reference to Barequet et al., 2006, for the lower bound). Upper bound is due to Klarner and Rivest, 1973. By Madras, 1999, it is now known that this limit, also known as Klarner's constant, is equal to the limit growth rate lim_{n->oo} a(n+1)/a(n).
Polyominoes are worth exploring in the elementary school classroom. Students in grade 2 can reproduce the first 6 terms. Grade 3 students can explore area and perimeter. Grade 4 students can talk about polyomino symmetries.
The pentominoes should be singled out for special attention: 1) they offer a nice, manageable set that a teacher can commercially acquire without too much expense. 2) There are also deeply strategic games and perplexing puzzles that are great for all students. 3) A fraction of students will become engaged because of the beautiful solutions.

Number of partitions of {1, ...,n+1} into subsets of nonconsecutive integers, including the partition 1|2|...|n+1. E.g., a(3)=5: there are 5 partitions of {1,2,3,4} into subsets of nonconsecutive integers, namely, 13|24, 13|2|4, 14|2|3, 1|24|3, 1|2|3|4. - _Augustine O. Munagi_, Mar 20 2005

With P(n) = the number of integer partitions of n, p(i) = the number of parts of the i-th partition of n, d(i) = the number of different parts of the i-th partition of n, p(j,i) = the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, m(i,j) = multiplicity of the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, one has: a(n) = Sum_{i=1..P(n)} (n!/(Product_{j=1..p(i)}p(i,j)!)) * (1/(Product_{j=1..d(i)} m(i,j)!)) - _Thomas Wieder_, May 18 2005

a(n) is the number of functions f from {1,...,n} to {1,...,n,n+1} that satisfy the following two conditions for all x in the domain: (1) f(x)>x; (2)f(x)=n+1 or f(f(x))=n+1. E.g., a(3)=5 because there are exactly five functions that satisfy the two conditions: f1={(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)}, f2={(1,4),(2,3),(3,4)}, f3={(1,3),(2,4),(3,4)}, f4={(1,2),(2,4),(3,4)} and f5={(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)}. - _Dennis P.

Number of asynchronic siteswap patterns of length n which have no zero-throws (i.e., contain no 0's) and whose number of orbits (in the sense given by Allen Knutson) is equal to the number of balls. E.g., for n=4, the condition is satisfied by the following 15 siteswaps: 4444, 4413, 4242, 4134, 4112, 3441, 2424, 1344, 2411, 1313, 1241, 2222, 3131, 1124, 1111. Also number of ways to choose n permutations from identity and cyclic permutations (1 2), (1 2 3), ..., (1 2 3 ... n) so that their composition is identity. For n=3 we get the following five: id o id o id, id o (1 2) o (1 2), (1 2) o id o (1 2), (1 2) o (1 2) o id, (1 2 3) o (1 2 3) o (1 2 3). (To see the bijection, look at Ehrenborg and Readdy paper.) - _Antti Karttunen_, May 01 2006
a(n) is the number of permutations on [n] in which a 3-2-1 (scattered) pattern occurs only as part of a 3-2-4-1 pattern. Example: a(3) = 5 counts all permutations on [3] except 321. See "Eigensequence for Composition" reference a(n) = number of permutation tableaux of size n (A000142) whose first row contains no 0's. Example: a(3)=5 counts {{}, {}, {}}, {{1}, {}}, {{1}, {0}}, {{1}, {1}}, {{1, 1}}. - _David Callan_, Oct 07 2006
Take the series 1^n/1! + 2^n/2! + 3^n/3! + 4^n/4! ... If n=1 then the result will be e, about 2.71828. If n=2, the result will be 2e. If n=3, the result will be 5e. This continues, following the pattern of the Bell numbers: e, 2e, 5e, 15e, 52e, 203e, etc. - Jonathan R. Love (japanada11(AT)yahoo.ca), Feb 22 2007

The terms can also be computed with finite steps and precise integer arithmetic. Instead of exp(P)/exp(1) one can compute A = exp(P - I) where I is the identity-matrix of appropriate dimension since (P-I) is nilpotent to the order of its dimension. Then a(n)=A[n,1] where n is the row-index starting at 1. - _Gottfried Helms_, Apr 10 2007
Define a Bell pseudoprime to be a composite number n such that a(n) == 2 (mod n). W. F. Lunnon recently found the Bell pseudoprimes 21361 = 41*521 and C46 = 3*23*16218646893090134590535390526854205539989357 and conjectured that Bell pseudoprimes are extremely scarce. So the second Bell pseudoprime is unlikely to be known with certainty in the near future. I confirmed that 21361 is the first. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 04 2007 and Sep 24 2007

Bell(n) is the number of n-pattern sequences [Cooper & Kennedy]. An n-pattern sequence is a sequence of integers (a_1,...,a_n) such that a_i = i or a_i = a_j for some j < i. For example, Bell(3) = 5 since the 3-pattern sequences are (1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,2,1), (1,2,2) and (1,2,3).
Bell(n) is the number of sequences of positive integers (N_1,...,N_n) of length n such that N_1 = 1 and N_(i+1) <= 1 + max{j = 1..i} N_j for i >= 1 (see the comment by B. Blewett above). It is interesting to note that if we strengthen the latter condition to N_(i+1) <= 1 + N_i we get the Catalan numbers A000108 instead of the Bell numbers.

c) for a given n, read off the sum of absolute values of coefficients of every term involving digamma or polygamma functions.

In fact it is not really an eigensequence of the Pascal matrix; rather the Pascal matrix acts on the sequence as a shift. It is an eigensequence (the unique eigensequence with eigenvalue 1) of the matrix derived from the Pascal matrix by adding at the top the row [1, 0, 0, 0 ...]. The binomial sum formula may be derived from the definition in terms of partitions: label any element X of a set S of N elements, and let X(k) be the number of subsets of S containing X with k elements. Since each subset has a unique coset, the number of partitions p(N) of S is given by p(N) = Sum_{k=1..N} (X(k) p(N-k)); trivially X(k) = N-1 choose k-1. - _Mason Bogue_, Mar 20 2015

The binary weight of n is a particular case of the digit sum (base b) of n. - _Daniel Forgues_, Mar 13 2015
The mean of the first n terms is 1 less than the mean of [a(n+1),...,a(2n)], which is also the mean of [a(n+2),...,a(2n+1)]. - _Christian Perfect_, Apr 02 2015
a(n) is also the largest part of the integer partition having viabin number n. The viabin number of an integer partition is defined in the following way. Consider the southeast border of the Ferrers board of the integer partition and consider the binary number obtained by replacing each east step with 1 and each north step, except the last one, with 0. The corresponding decimal form is, by definition, the viabin number of the given integer partition. "Viabin" is coined from "via binary". For example, consider the integer partition [2,2,2,1]. The southeast border of its Ferrers board yields 10100, leading to the viabin number 20. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 20 2017

The first line cuts the pancake into 2 pieces. For n > 1, the n-th line crosses every earlier line (avoids parallelism) and also avoids every previous line intersection, thus increasing the number of pieces by n. For 16 lines, for example, the number of pieces is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 16 = 137. These are the triangular numbers plus 1 (cf. A000217).

Note that a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). This has the following geometrical interpretation: Suppose there are already n-1 lines in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions in the plane obtainable by n-1 lines and now one more line is added in general arrangement. Then it will cut each of the n-1 lines and acquire intersection points which are in general arrangement. (See the comments on A000027 for general arrangement with points.) These points on the new line define the maximal number of regions in 1-space definable by n-1 points, hence this is A000027(n-1), where for A000027 an offset of 0 is assumed, that is, A000027(n-1) = (n+1)-1 = n. Each of these regions acts as a dividing wall, thereby creating as many new regions in addition to the a(n-1) regions already there, hence a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). Cf. the comments on A000125 for an analogous interpretation. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006
When constructing a zonohedron, one zone at a time, out of (up to) 3-d non-intersecting parallelepipeds, the n-th element of this sequence is the number of edges in the n-th zone added with the n-th "layer" of parallelepipeds. (Verified up to 10-zone zonohedron, the enneacontahedron.) E.g., adding the 10th zone to the enneacontahedron requires 46 parallel edges (edges in the 10th zone) by looking directly at a 5-valence vertex and counting visible vertices. - _Shel Kaphan_, Feb 16 2006

PROPERTIES: 
Note that a(n) = a(n-1) + A000124(n-1). This has the following geometrical interpretation: Define a number of planes in space to be in general arrangement when
(1) no two planes are parallel,
(2) there are no two parallel intersection lines,
(3) there is no point common to four or more planes.
Suppose there are already n-1 planes in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions in space obtainable by n-1 planes and now one more plane is added in general arrangement. Then it will cut each of the n-1 planes and acquire intersection lines which are in general arrangement. (See the comments on A000124 for general arrangement with lines.) These lines on the new plane define the maximal number of regions in 2-space definable by n-1 straight lines, hence this is A000124(n-1). Each of this regions acts as a dividing wall, thereby creating as many new regions in addition to the a(n-1) regions already there, hence a(n)=a(n-1)+A000124(n-1). - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006
More generally, we have: A000027(n) = binomial(n,0) + binomial(n,1) (the natural numbers), A000124(n) = binomial(n,0) + binomial(n,1) + binomial(n,2) (the Lazy Caterer's sequence), a(n) = binomial(n,0) + binomial(n,1) + binomial(n,2) + binomial(n,3) (Cake Numbers). - Peter C.

Given n tiles with two values - an A value and a B value - a player may pick either the A value or the B value. The particular tiles are [n, 0], [n-1, 1], ..., [2, n-2] and [1, n-1]. The sequence is the number of different final A:B counts. For example, with n=4, we can have final total [5, 3] = [4, _] + [_, 1] + [_, 2] + [1, _] = [_, 0] + [3, _] + [2, _] + [_, 3], so a(4) = 2^4 - 1 = 15. The largest and smallest final A+B counts are given by A077043 and A002620 respectively. - _Jon Perry_, Oct 24 2014

From _Charlie Marion_, Jan 07 2009: (Start)
In general, denominators, a(k,n) and numerators, b(k,n), of continued fraction convergents to sqrt((k+1)/k) may be found as follows:
let a(k,0) = 1, a(k,1) = 2k; for n > 0, a(k,2n) = 2*a(k,2n-1) + a(k,2n-2)
and a(k,2n+1) = (2k)*a(k,2n) + a(k,2n-1);
let b(k,0) = 1, b(k,1) = 2k+1; for n > 0, b(k,2n) = 2*b(k,2n-1) + b(k,2n-2)
and b(k,2n+1) = (2k)*b(k,2n) + b(k,2n-1).
For example, the convergents to sqrt(2/1) start 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29.
In general, if a(k,n) and b(k,n) are the denominators and numerators, respectively, of continued fraction convergents to sqrt((k+1)/k) as defined above, then
k*a(k,2n)^2 - a(k,2n-1)*a(k,2n+1) = k = k*a(k,2n-2)*a(k,2n) - a(k,2n-1)^2 and
b(k,2n-1)*b(k,2n+1) - k*b(k,2n)^2 = k+1 = b(k,2n-1)^2 - k*b(k,2n-2)*b(k,2n);
for example, if k=1 and n=3, then a(1,n) = a(n+1) and
1*a(1,6)^2 - a(1,5)*a(1,7) = 1*169^2 - 70*408 = 1;
1*a(1,4)*a(1,6) - a(1,5)^2 = 1*29*169 - 70^2 = 1;
b(1,5)*b(1,7) - 1*b(1,6)^2 = 99*577 - 1*239^2 = 2;
b(1,5)^2 - 1*b(1,4)*b(1,6) = 99^2 - 1*41*239 = 2.

Starting with offset 1 = row sums of triangle A155002, equivalent to the statement that the Fibonacci series convolved with the Pell series prefaced with a "1": (1, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, ...) = (1, 2, 5, 12, 29, ...).  -_Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 18 2009
It appears that P(p) == 8^((p-1/2)) mod p, p = prime; analogous to [Schroeder, p.90]: Fp == 5^((p-1)/2)) mod p. Example: Given P(11) = 5741, == 8^5 mod 11. Given P(17) = 11336689, == 8^8 mod 17 since 17 divides (8^8 - P(l7)). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Feb 21 2009

Another combinatorial interpretation of a(n-1) arises from a simple tiling scenario. Namely, a(n-1) gives the number of ways of tiling a 1 X n rectangle with indistinguishable 1 X 2 rectangles and 1 X 1 squares that come in two varieties, say, A and B. For example, with C representing the 1 X 2 rectangle, we obtain a(4)=12 from AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB, BBA, BBB, AC, BC, CA and CB. - _Martin Griffiths_, Apr 25 2009

Define a t-circle to be a first-quadrant circle tangent to the x- and y-axes. Such a circle has coordinates equal to its radius. Let C(0) be the t-circle with radius 1. Then for n > 0, define C(n) to be the next larger t-circle which is tangent to C(n - 1). C(n) has radius A001333(2n) + a(2n)*sqrt(2) and each of the coordinates of its point of intersection with C(n + 1) is a(2n + 1) + (A001333(2n + 1)*sqrt(2))/2.

Between every two consecutive squares of a 1 X n array there is a flap that can be folded over one of the two squares. Two flaps can be lowered over the same square in 2 ways, depending on which one is on top. The n-th Pell number counts the ways n-1 flaps can be lowered. For example, a sideway representation for the case n = 3 squares and 2 flaps is \\., .//, \./, ./_., ._\., where . is an empty square. - _Jean M. Morales_, Sep 18 2013
Define a(-n) to be a(n) for n odd and -a(n) for n even. Then a(n) = A005319(k)*(a(n-2k+1) - a(n-2k)) + a(n-4k) = A075870(k)*(a(n-2k+2) - a(n-2k+1)) - a(n-4k+2)). - _Charlie Marion_, Nov 26 2013

A strong divisibility sequence, that is, gcd(a(n), a(m)) = a(gcd(n, m)) for all positive integers n and m. - _Michael Somos_, Jan 03 2017
a(n) is the number of compositions (ordered partitions) of n-1 into two kinds of parts, n and n', when the order of the 1 does not matter, or equivalently, when the order of the 1' does not matter. Example: When the order of the 1 does not matter, the a(3)=5 compositions of 3-1=2 are 1+1, 1+1'=1+1, 1'+1', 2 and 2'. (Contrast with entry from _Bob Selcoe_ dated Jun 21 2013.) - _Gregory L.

Let A(r,n) be the total number of ordered arrangements of an n+r tiling of r red squares and white tiles of total length n, where the individual tile lengths can range from 1 to n. A(r,0) corresponds to a tiling of r red squares only, and so A(r,0)=1. Let A_1(r,n) = Sum{j=0..n} A(r,j) and let A_s(r,n) = Sum{j=0..n}A_(s-1)(r,j). Then A_0(1,n) + A_2(3,n-4) + A_4(5,n-8) +...+ A_(2j) (2j+1, n-4j) = a(n) without the initial 0. - _Gregory L. Simay_, May 25 2018

Row maxima of A008302, see example.
The term a(0) would be 1: the empty product is one and there is just one coefficient 1=x^0, corresponding to the 1 empty permutation (which has 0 inversions).
From Ryen Lapham and _Anant Godbole_, Dec 12 2006: (Start)
Also, the number of permutations on {1,2,...,n} for which the number A of monotone increasing subsequences of length 2 and the number D of monotone decreasing 2-subsequences are as close to each other as possible, i.e., 0 or 1. We call such permutations 2-balanced.
If 4|n(n-1) then (with A and D as above) the feasible values of A-D are C(n,2), C(n,2)-2,...,2,0,-2,...,-C(n,2), whereas if 4 does not divide n(n-1), A-D may equal C(n,2), C(n,2)-2,...,1,-1,...,-C(n,2). Let a_n(i) equal the number of permutations with A-D the i-th highest feasible value.
The sequence in question gives the number of permutations for which A-D=0 or A-D=1, i.e., it equals A_n(j) where j = floor((binomial(n,2)+2)/2). Here is the recursion: a_n(i) = a_n(i-1) + a_{n-1}(i) for 1 <= i <= n and a_n(n+k) = a_n(n+k-1) + a_{n-1}(n+k) - a_n(k) for k >= 1. (End)

For n >= 1, a(n) is the number of n X n (0,1) matrices with each row and column containing exactly one entry equal to 1.
This sequence is the BinomialMean transform of A000354. (See A075271 for definition.) - _John W. Layman_, Sep 12 2002 [This is easily verified from the Paul Barry formula for A000354, by interchanging summations and using the formula: Sum_k (-1)^k C(n-i, k) = KroneckerDelta(i,n). - _David Callan_, Aug 31 2003]

Given n objects of distinct sizes (e.g., areas, volumes) such that each object is sufficiently large to simultaneously contain all previous objects, then n! is the total number of essentially different arrangements using all n objects. Arbitrary levels of nesting of objects are permitted within arrangements. (This application of the sequence was inspired by considering leftover moving boxes.) If the restriction exists that each object is able or permitted to contain at most one smaller (but possibly nested) object at a time, the resulting sequence begins 1,2,5,15,52 (Bell Numbers?). Sets of nested wooden boxes or traditional nested Russian dolls come to mind here. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Jan 14 2004

a(n+1)=:b(n), n>=1, enumerates the ways to distribute n beads labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and two indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as a beadless cords contribute each a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., b(0):= 1*1 = 1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads.
This produces for b(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and {(n+1)!}={A000042(n+1}. This follows from the general problem with only k indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords which has e.g.f. 1/(1-x)^k, and the pure necklace problem (no necklaces with one bead allowed) with e.g.f. for the subfactorials. Therefore also the recurrence b(n) = (n+1)*b(n-1) + (n-1)*b(n-2) with b(-1)=0 and b(0)=1 holds.
This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 02 2010
a(n) is a function of the subfactorials..sf... A000166(n) a(n) = (n*sf(n+1) - (n+1)*sf(n))/(2*n*(n-1)*(n+1)),n>1, with offset 1. - _Gary Detlefs_, Nov 06 2010
For even k the sequence a(n) (mod k) is purely periodic with exact period a divisor of k, while for odd k the sequence a(n) (mod k) is purely periodic with exact period a divisor of 2*k. See A047974. - _Peter Bala_, Dec 04 2017

The Carlitz paper has the wrong formula on p. 505, eq. (3). The factor in front of tau(n/2) should be -2^16 (not -2^12). The mistake appeared in the previous equation derived from eq. (2) where theta_3^(24) * 256*k^4*k'^4 was replaced by 2^8*g(q^2) which produces the factor 2^8*256 = 2^16. (One should subtract on  p. 504 the second equation in the middle from the negative of the first equation. There is also a sign mistake in the sum term of the third equation from the bottom.)  - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 24 2016

a(n) is the number of increasing plane trees with n+1 edges. (In a plane tree, each subtree of the root is an ordered tree but the subtrees of the root may be cyclically rotated.) Increasing means the vertices are labeled 0,1,2,...,n+1 and each child has a greater label than its parent. Cf.

a(n) = number of permutations of the multiset {1,1,2,2,...,n,n,n+1,n+1} such that between the two occurrences of i, there is exactly one entry >i, for i=1,2,...,n. Example: a(2) = 8 counts 121323, 131232, 213123, 231213, 232131, 312132, 321312, 323121. Proof: There is always exactly one entry between the two 1s (when n>=1). Given a permutation p in A(n) (counted by a(n)), record the position i of the first 1, then delete both 1s and subtract 1 from every entry to get a permutation q in A(n-1). The mapping p -> (i,q) is a bijection from A(n) to the Cartesian product [1,2n] X A(n-1). - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2007

Assuming n starts at 0, a(n) appears to be the number of Gray codes on n bits. It certainly is the number of Gray codes on n bits isomorphic to the canonical one. Proof: There are 2^n different starting positions for each code. Also, each code has a particular pattern of bit positions that are flipped (for instance, 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 for n=3), and these bit position patterns can be permuted in n! ways. - D. J.

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having exactly one small ascent. A small ascent in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_{i+1} - p_i = 1. (Example: a(3) = 2 because we have 312 and 231; see the Charalambides reference, pp. 176-180.) [See also David, Kendall and Barton, p. 263. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 11 2014]
a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having exactly one small descent. A small descent in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_i - p_{i+1} = 1. (Example: a(3)=2 because we have 132 and 213.) (End)
For n > 2, a(n) + a(n-1) = A000255(n-1); where A000255 = (1, 1, 3, 11, 53, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 16 2009
Connection to A002469 (game of mousetrap with n cards): A002469(n) = (n-2)*A000255(n-1) + A000166(n). (Cf. triangle A159610). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 17 2009
From _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 18 2009: (Start)
a(n) is the sum of the values of the largest fixed points of all non-derangements of length n-1. Example: a(4)=9 because the non-derangements of length 3 are 123, 132, 213, and 321, having largest fixed points 3, 1, 3, and 2, respectively.
a(n) is the number of non-derangements of length n+1 for which the difference between the largest and smallest fixed point is 2. Example: a(3) = 2 because we have 1'43'2 and 32'14'; a(4) = 9 because we have 1'23'54, 1'43'52, 1'53'24, 52'34'1, 52'14'3, 32'54'1, 213'45', 243'15', and 413'25' (the extreme fixed points are marked).
(End)
a(n), n >= 1, is also the number of unordered necklaces with n beads, labeled differently from 1 to n, where each necklace has >= 2 beads. This produces the M2 multinomial formula involving partitions without part 1 given below. Because M2(p) counts the permutations with cycle structure given by partition p, this formula gives the number of permutations without fixed points (no 1-cycles), i.e., the derangements, hence the subfactorials with their recurrence relation and inputs. Each necklace with no beads is assumed to contribute a factor 1 in the counting, hence a(0)=1. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 01 2010

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n, n+1} starting with 1 and having no successions. A succession in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_{i+1} - p_i = 1. Example: a(3)=2 because we have 1324 and 1432.

Consider n circles of different radii, where each circle is either put inside some bigger circle or contains a smaller circle inside it (no common points are allowed). Then a(n) gives the number of such combinations. - _Anton Zakharov_, Oct 12 2016
If we partition the permutations of [n+1] in A000240 according to their starting digit, we will get (n+1) equinumerous classes each of size a(n), i.e., A000240(n+1) = (n+1)*a(n), hence a(n) is the size of each class of permutations of [n+1] in A000240. For example, for n = 4 we have 45 = 5*9. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 10 2017
Call d_n1 the permutations of [n] that have the substring n1 but no substring in {12,23,...,(n-1)n}. If we partition them according to their starting digit, we will get (n-1) equinumerous classes each of size A000166(n-2) (the class starting with the digit 1 is empty since we must have the substring n1). Hence d_n1 = (n-1)*A000166(n-2) and A000166(n-2) is the size of each nonempty class in d_n1. For example, d_71 = 6*44 = 264, so there are 264 permutations in d_71 distributed in 6 nonempty classes of size A000166(5) = 44. (To get permutations in d_n1 recursively from more basic ones see the link "Forbidden Patterns" below.) - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 15 2017

The sequence a(n) taken modulo a positive integer k is periodic with exact period dividing k when k is even and dividing 2*k when k is odd. This follows from the congruence a(n+k) = (-1)^k*a(n) (mod k) for all n and k, which in turn is easily proved by induction making use of the recurrence a(n) = n*a(n-1) + (-1)^n. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 21 2017
a(n) is the number of unique possible solutions for a directed, no self loop containing graph, that has n vertices, and each vertice has an in- and out-degree of exactly 1. - _Patrik Holopainen_, Sep 18 2018

From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jun 25 2015: (Start)
According to the ménage problem, 2*n!*a(n) is the number of ways of seating n married couples at 2*n chairs around a circular table, men and women in alternate positions, so that no husband is next to his wife.
It is known [Riordan, ch. 7] that a(n) is the number of arrangements of n non-attacking rooks on the positions of the 1's in an n X n (0,1)-matrix A_n with 0's in positions (i,i), i = 1,...,n, (i,i+1), i = 1,...,n-1, and (n,1). This statement could be written as a(n) = per(A_n). For example, A_5 has the form
001*11
1*0011
11001*                        (1)
11*100
0111*0,
where 5 non-attacking rooks are denoted by {1*}.
We can indicate a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of n non-attacking rooks on the 1's of a matrix A_n and arrangements of n married couples around a circular table by the rules of the ménage problem, after the ladies w_1, w_2,..., w_n have taken the chairs numbered
2*n, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2         (2)
respectively. Suppose we consider an  arrangement of rooks: (1,j_1), (2,j_2),..., (n,j_n). Then the men m_1, m_2,..., m_n took chairs with numbers
2*j_i - 3 (mod 2*n),          (3)
where the residues are chosen from the interval[1,2*n]. Indeed {j_i} is a permutation of 1,...,n. So {2*j_i-3}(mod 2*n) is a permutation of odd positive integers <= 2*n-1. Besides, the distance between m_i and w_i cannot be 1. Indeed, the equality |2*(j_i-i)-1| = 1 (mod 2*n) is possible if and only if either j_i=i or j_i=i+1 (mod n) that correspond to positions of 0's in matrix A_n.
For example, in the case of positions of {1*} in(1) we have j_1=3, j_2=1, j_3=5, j_4=2, j_5=4. So, by(2) and (3) the chairs 1,2,...,10 are taken by m_4, w_2, m_1, w_3, m_5, w_4, m_3, w_5, m_2, w_1, respectively. (End)
The first 20 terms of this sequence were calculated in 1891 by E. Lucas (see [Lucas, p. 495]). - _Peter J. C. Moses_, Jun 26 2015
From _Ira M. Gessel_, Nov 27 2018: (Start)
If we invert the formula
  Sum_{ n>=0 } u_n z^n = ((1-z)/(1+z)) F(z/(1+z)^2)
that Don Knuth mentions (see link) (i.e., set x=z/(1+z)^2 and solve for z in terms of x), we get a formula for F(z) = Sum_{n >= 0} n! z^n as a sum with all positive coefficients of (almost) powers of the Catalan number generating function.
The exact formula is (5) of the Yiting Li article.
This article also gives a combinatorial proof of this formula (though it is not as simple as one might want). (End)

a(n) was found to be the number of permutations of [2n] which when inserted in order, to form a binary search tree, yield the maximally full possible tree (with only one single-child node).
The e.g.f. is sec^2(x)=1+tan^2(x), and the same coefficients can be manufactured from the tan(x) itself, which is the e.g.f. for the number of trees as above for odd number of nodes. (End)

Proof that (2) = (3): Let max{[gcd(d, n/d)} = K, then d = Kx, n/d = Ky so n = KKxy where xy is the squarefree part of n, otherwise K is not maximal. Observe also that g = gcd(K, xy) is not necessarily 1. Thus K is also the "maximal square-root factor" of n. - _Labos Elemer_, July 2000

Define the oblong root obrt(x) to be the (larger) solution of y * (y+1) = x; i.e., obrt(x) = sqrt(x+1/4) - 1/2. So obrt(x) is an integer iff x is an oblong number (A002378). Then a(n) = ceiling(obrt(n)). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jun 24 2015
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 12 2019: (Start)
The general Pell equation is related to the non reduced form F(n) = Xvec^T A(n) Xvec = x^2 - D(n)*y^2 with D(n) = A000037(n) (D not a square), Xvec = (x,y)^T (T for transposed) and A(n) = matrix[[1,0], [0,-D(n)]]. The discriminant of F(n) = [1, 0, -D(n)] is 4*D(n).
The first reduced form appears after two applications of an equivalence transformation A' = R^T A R obtained with R = R(t) = matrix([0, -1], [1, t]), namely first with t = 0, leading to the still not reduced form [-D, 0, 1], and then with t = ceiling(f(4*D(n))/2 - 1), where f(4*D(n)) = ceiling(2*sqrt(D(n))). This can be shown to be a(n), which is also D(n) - n, for n >= 1 (see a formula below).
This leads to the reduced form FR(n) = [1, 2*a(n), -(D(n) - a(n)^2)] = [1, 2*a(n), -(n - a(n)*(a(n) - 1)]. Example: n = 5, a(5) = 2: D(5) = 7 and FR(5) = [1, 4, -3].  (End)

This is the unique sequence a satisfying a'(n)=a(a(n))+1 for all n in the set N of natural numbers, where a' denotes the ordered complement (in N) of a. - _Clark Kimberling_, Feb 17 2003
This sequence and A001950 may be defined as follows. Consider the maps a -> ab, b -> a, starting from a(1) = a; then A000201 gives the indices of a, A001950 gives the indices of b. The sequence of letters in the infinite word begins a, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, a, b, a, ... Setting a = 0, b = 1 gives A003849 (offset 0); setting a = 1, b = 0 gives A005614 (offset 0). - _Philippe Deléham_, Feb 20 2004
These are the numbers whose lazy Fibonacci representation (see A095791) includes 1; the complementary sequence (the upper Wythoff sequence, A001950) are the numbers whose lazy Fibonacci representation includes 2 but not 1.
a(n) is the unique monotonic sequence satisfying a(1)=1 and the condition "if n is in the sequence then n+(rank of n) is not in the sequence" (e.g. a(4)=6 so 6+4=10 and 10 is not in the sequence) - _Benoit Cloitre_, Mar 31 2006
Write A for A000201 and B for A001950 (the upper Wythoff sequence, complement of A). Then the composite sequences AA, AB, BA, BB, AAA, AAB,...,BBB,... appear in many complementary equations having solution A000201 (or equivalently, A001950). Typical complementary equations: AB=A+B (=A003623), BB=A+2B (=A101864), BBB=3A+5B (=A134864). - _Clark Kimberling_, Nov 14 2007
Cumulative sum of A001468 terms. - _Eric Angelini_, Aug 19 2008
The lower Wythoff sequence also can be constructed by playing the so-called Mancala-game: n piles of total d(n) chips are standing in a row. The piles are numbered from left to right by 1, 2, 3, ... . The number of chips in a pile at the beginning of the game is equal to the number of the pile. One step of the game is described as follows: Distribute the pile on the very left one by one to the piles right of it. If chips are remaining, build piles out of one chip subsequently to the right. After f(n) steps the game ends in a constant row of piles. The lower Wythoff sequence is also given by n -> f(n). - Roland Schroeder (florola(AT)gmx.de), Jun 19 2010
With the exception of the first term, a(n) gives the number of iterations required to reverse the list {1,2,3,...,n} when using the mapping defined as follows: remove the first term of the list, z(1), and add 1 to each of the next z(1) terms (appending 1's if necessary) to get a new list. See A183110 where this mapping is used and other references given.  This appears to be essentially the Mancala-type game interpretation given by R. Schroeder above. - _John W. Layman_, Feb 03 2011

This comment covers a family of sequences which satisfy a recurrence of the form a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-m), with a(n) = 1 for n = 1...m-1, a(m) = m+1. The generating function is (x+m*x^m)/(1-x-x^m).

PROPERTIES: 
From _Markus Voege_, Nov 24 2009: (Start)
On the difference between this sequence and A038147:
The first term that differs is for n=6; for all subsequent terms, the number of polyhexes is larger than the number of planar polyhexes.
If I recall correctly, polyhexes are clusters of regular hexagons that are joined at the edges and are LOCALLY embeddable in the hexagonal lattice.
"Planar polyhexes" are polyhexes that are GLOBALLY embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.
Example: (Planar) polyhex with 6 cells (x) and a hole (O):
.. x x
. x O x
.. x x
Polyhex with 6 cells that is cut open (I):
.. xIx
. x O x
.. x x
This polyhex is not globally embeddable in the honeycomb lattice, since adjacent cells of the lattice must be joined. But it can be embedded locally everywhere. It is a start of a spiral. For n>6 the spiral can be continued so that the cells overlap.
Illegal configuration with cut (I):
.. xIx
. x x x
.. x x
This configuration is NOT a polyhex since the vertex at
.. xIx
... x
is not embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.
One has to keep in mind that these definitions are inspired by chemistry. Hence, potential molecules are often the motivation for these definitions. Think of benzene rings that are fused at a C-C bond.
The (planar) polyhexes are "free" configurations, in contrast to "fixed" configurations as in A001207 = Number of fixed hexagonal polyominoes with n cells.
A000228 (planar polyhexes) and A001207 (fixed polyominoes) differ only by the attribute "free" vs. "fixed," that is, whether the different orientations and reflections of an embedding in the lattice are counted.
The configuration
. x x .... x
.. x .... x x
is counted once as free and twice as fixed configurations.
Since most configurations have no symmetry, (A001207 / A000228) -> 12 for n -> infinity. (End)

PROPERTIES: 
a(n) is also the number of permutations of [n] having no circular succession. A circular succession in a permutation p of [n] is either a pair p(i), p(i+1), where p(i+1)=p(i)+1 or the pair p(n), p(1) if p(1)=p(n)+1. a(4)=8 because we have 1324, 1432, 4132, 2143, 2413, 3214, 3241, and 4321. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Sep 06 2010
a(n) is also the number of permutations of [n] having no substring in {12, 23, ..., (n-1)n, n1}. For example, a(4) = 8 since we have 1324, 1432, 4213, 2143, 2431, 3214, 3142, 4321 (different from permutations having no circular succession). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Oct 07 2016
a(n-1) is also the number of permutations of [n] that allow the substring n1 in the set of permutations of [n] having no substring in {12, 23, ..., (n-1)n}. For example, for n=5 the 8 permutations in S5 having no substring in {12,23,34,45} that allow the substring 51 are {51324,51432,25143,24351,35142,32514,42513,43251} (see link). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 11 2017
From _Enrique Navarrete_, Mar 25 2017: (Start)
Let D(n,k) be the set of permutations on [n] that for fixed k, 0 < k < n, avoid substrings j(j+k) for 1 <= j <= n - k, and avoid substrings j(j+k) (mod n) for n-k < j <= n. Then the number of permutations in D(n,k) with k relative prime to n, n>=2, is given by a(n). For example, the forbidden substrings in D(4,3) are {14;21,32,43} (the forbidden substrings (mod 4) are written after the semicolon and lie below the diagonal in the chessboard below):
                                1 2 3 4
                             1 |_|_|_|x|
                             2 |x|_|_|_|
                             3 |_|x|_|_|
                             4 |_|_|x|_|
_
Then since 4 and 3 are relatively prime, a(4)=8, and the permutations in D(4,3) are 1234, 1342, 2341, 2413, 3124, 3412, 4123, 4231.

SEQUENCE: 0,0,0,0,0,1,3,9,18,36,60,100,150,225,315,441,588Crossing number of complete graph with n nodes.It was conjectured by A. Hill in 1958 (see Guy 1960 and Harary-Hill 1963) that a(n) = floor(n/2)*floor((n-1)/2)*floor((n-2)/2)*floor((n-3)/2)/4 (see A028723). This is also sometimes referred to as Guy's conjecture. - _N. J.

From _Paul Barry_, Oct 02 2008: (Start)
Another version of the conjecture is that a(n)=C(floor(n/2),2)*C(floor((n-1)/2),2).
We conjecture that this sequence is also given by one half of the third coefficient of the denominator polynomial of the n-th convergent to the g.f. of n!.

From the Lackenby reference: "One of the most basic questions in knot theory remains unresolved: is crossing number additive under connected sum? In other words, does the equality c(K1#K2) = c(K1) + c(K2) always hold, where c(K) denotes the crossing number of a knot K and K1#K2 is the connected sum of two (oriented) knots K1 and K2? Theorem 1.1. Let K1, . . .,Kn be oriented knots in the 3-sphere. Then (c(K1) + . . . + c(Kn)) / 152 <= c(K1# . . . #Kn) <= c(K1) + . . . + c(Kn)." - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Aug 26 2009

The compositions of n in which each natural number is colored by one of p different colors are called p-colored compositions of n. For n >= 1, a(n) equals the number of 3-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color. - _Milan Janjic_, Nov 17 2011
Explanation from _David Applegate_, Feb 20 2017. (Start)  Since the preceding comment appears in a large number of sequences, it might be worth adding a proof.
The number of compositions of n into exactly k parts is binomial(n-1,k-1).
For a p-colored composition of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color, there are exactly p choices for the color of the first part, and p-1 choices for the color of each additional part (any color other than the color of the previous one). So, for a partition into k parts, there are p (p-1)^(k-1) valid colorings.
Thus the number of p-colored compositions of n into exactly k parts such that no adjacent parts have the same color is binomial(n-1,k-1) p (p-1)^(k-1).
The total number of p-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color is then
sum_{k=1..n} binomial(n-1,k-1) * p * (p-1)^(k-1) = p^n.
To see this, note that the binomial expansion of ((p-1)+1)^(n-1) = Sum_{k=0..n-1} binomial(n-1,k) (p-1)^k 1^(n-1-k) = Sum_{k=1..n} binomial(n-1,k-1) (p-1)^(k-1).

The sequence with interspersed zeros and o.g.f. x/(1- 3*x^2), A(2*k) = 0, A(2*k+1) = 3^k = a(k), k >= 0, can be called hexagon numbers. This is because the algebraic number rho(6) = 2*cos(Pi/6) = sqrt(3) of degree 2, with minimal polynomial C(6, x) = x^2 - 3 (see A187360, n = 6), is the length ratio of the smaller diagonal and the side in the hexagon. Hence rho(6)^n = A(n-1)*1 + A(n)*rho(6), in the power basis of the quadratic number field Q(rho(6)). One needs also A(-1) = 1. See also a Dec 02 2010 comment and the P.

The least number k > 0 such that 3^k ends in n consecutive decreasing digits is a 3-term sequence given by {1, 13, 93}. The consecutive increasing digits are {3, 23, 123}. There are 100 different 3-digit endings for 3^k. There are no k-values such that 3^k ends in '012', '234', '345', '456', '567', '678', or '789'. The k-values for which 3^k ends in '123' are given by 93 mod 100. For k = 93 + 100*x, the digit immediately before the run of '123' is {9, 5, 1, 7, 3, 9, 5, 1, 3, 7, ...} for x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}, respectively. Thus we see the digit before '123' will never be a 0. So there are no further terms. - _Derek Orr_, Jul 03 2014

SEQUENCE: 1,1,1,3,9,45,225,1575,11025,99225,893025,9823275,108056025,1404728325,18261468225,273922023375,4108830350625,69850115960625,1187451971330625,22561587455281875,428670161650355625,9002073394657468125,189043541287806830625
PROPERTIES: 
Michael Reid (mreid(AT)math.umass.edu) points out that the e.g.f. for the number of permutations of odd order can be obtained from the cycle index for S_n, F(Y; X1, X2, X3, ... ) := e^(X1 Y + X2 Y^2/2 + X3 Y^3/3 + ... ) and is F(Y, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ) = sqrt((1 + Y)/(1 - Y)).
a(n) appears to be the number of permutations on [n] whose up-down signature has nonnegative partial sums. For example, the up-down signature of (2,4,5,1,3) is (+1,+1,-1,+1) with nonnegative partial sums 1,2,1,2 and a(3)=3 counts (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,3,1). - _David Callan_, Jul 14 2006
This conjecture has been confirmed, see Bernardi, Duplantier, Nadeau link.
a(n) is the number of permutations of [n] for which all left-to-right minima occur in odd locations in the permutation. For example, a(3)=3 counts 123, 132, 231. Proof: For such a permutation of length 2n, you can append 1,2,..., or 2n+1 (2n+1 choices) and increase by 1 the original entries that weakly exceed the appended entry. This gives all such permutations of length 2n+1. But if the original length is 2n-1, you cannot append 1 (for then 1 would be a left-to-right min in an even location) so you can only append 2,3,..., or 2n (2n-1 choices). This count matches the given recurrence relation a(2n)=(2n-1)a(2n-1), a(2n+1)=(2n+1)a(2n). - _David Callan_, Jul 22 2008

a(n) is the number of ways to select a set partition of {1,2,...,n} and then designate one element in each block (cell) of the partition.
Let set B have cardinality n. Then a(n) is the number of functions f:D->C over all partitions {D,C} of B. See the example in the Example Section below. We note that f:empty set->B is designated as the null function, whereas f:B->empty set is undefined unless B itself is empty. [_Dennis P. Walsh_, Dec 05 2013]
In physics a(n) would be interpreted as the number of projection operators P on S_n, i.e., ones satisfying P^2 = P. Example: a particle with a half-integer spin s has a spin space with 2s+1 base states which admits a(2s+1) linear projection operators (including the identity). These are important because they satisfy the operator identity exp(zU) = 1+(exp(z)-1)*U, valid for any complex z. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Nov 03 2016

From Holger Petersen (petersen(AT)informatik.uni-stuttgart.de), May 29 2006:  (Start)
Also number of binary strings of length n+2 containing the pattern 010. Proof: Clear for n = 0, 1, 2. For n > 2 each string with pattern 010 of length n-1 gives 2 strings of length n with the property by appending a symbol. In addition each string of length n-1 without 010 and ending in 01 contributes one new string. Denote by c_w(m) the number of strings of length m without 010 and ending in w.
Since there is a total of 2^m strings of length m, we have c_01(m) = c_0(m-1) = (2^{m-1} - a(m-3)) - c_1(m-1) = (2^{m-1} - a(m-3)) - (2^{m-2} - a(m-4)) = 2^{m-2} - a(m-3) + a(m-4) (the first and third equalities follow from the fact that appending a 1 will not generate the pattern). The recurrence is a(n) = 2a(n-1) + c_01(n+1) = 2a(n-1) + 2^{n-1} - a(n-2) + a(n-3).

Proof from Richard Brualdi and _W. Edwin Clark_, Nov 15 2003: Let n >= 4. Take an n X n (0,1)-matrix A which is nonsingular. It has t >= n-1, 0's, otherwise there will be two rows of all 1's. Let B be the matrix obtained from A by replacing t-(n-1) of A's 0's with 1's. Let D be the matrix with all 1's except for 0's in the first n-1 positions on the diagonal. This matrix is easily seen to be non-singular. Now we have per(A) < = per(B) < = per (D), where the first inequality follows since replacing 0's by 1's cannot decrease the permanent and the second from Corollary 4.4 in the Brualdi et al. reference, which shows that per(D) is the maximum permanent of ANY n X n matrix with n -1 0's. Corollary 4.4 requires n >= 4. a(n) for n < 4 can be computed directly.
With offset 1, permanent of (0,1)-matrix of size n X (n+d) with d=1 and n zeros not on a line. This is a special case of Theorem 2.3 of Seok-Zun Song et al., Extremes of permanents of (0,1)-matrices, pp. 201-202. - _Jaap Spies_, Dec 12 2003

a(n), n >= 1, enumerates also the ways to distribute n beads, labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and one open cord allowed to have any number of beads. Each beadless necklace as well as the beadless cord contributes a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., a(0):=1*1=1. There are k! possibilities for the cord with k>=0 beads, which means that the two ends of the cord should be considered as fixed, in short: a fixed cord. This produces for a(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the sequences {n!=A000142(n)} and the subfactorials {A000166(n)}.
See the formula below. Alternatively, the e.g.f. for this problem is seen to be (exp(-x)/(1-x))*(1/(1-x)), namely the product of the e.g.f.s for the subfactorials (from the unordered necklace problem, without necklaces with exactly one bead) and the factorials (from the fixed cord problem). Therefore the recurrence with inputs holds also. a(0):=1.

If we partition the permutations of [n+2] in A000166 according to their starting digit, we will get (n+1) equinumerous classes each of size a(n) (the class starting with the digit 1 is empty since no derangement starts with 1). Hence, A000166(n+2)=(n+1)*a(n), so a(n) is the size of each nonempty class of permutations of [n+2] in A000166. For example, for n=3 we have 44=4*11 (see link). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 11 2017
For n >= 1, the number of circular permutations (in cycle notation) on [n+2] that avoid substrings (j,j+2), 1 <= j <= n.  For example, for n=2, the 3 circular permutations in S4 that avoid substrings {13,24} are (1234),(1423),(1432). Note that each of these circular permutations represent 4 permutations in one-line notation (see link 2017). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Feb 15 2017
The sequence a(n) taken modulo a positive integer k is periodic with exact period dividing k when k is even and dividing 2*k when k is odd. This follows from the congruence a(n+k) = (-1)^k*a(n) (mod k) holding for all n and k, which in turn is easily proved by induction making use of the given recurrences. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 21 2017

a(n+2)=:b(n), n>=1, enumerates the ways to distribute n beads, labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and three indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as a beadless cords contribute each a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., b(0):= 1*1 =1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads.
This produces for b(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and the sequence {A001710(n+2)}. See the necklaces and cords problem comment in A000153. Therefore also the recurrence b(n) = (n+2)*b(n-1) + (n-1)*b(n-2) with b(-1)=0 and b(0)=1 holds. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 02 2010

Consider all n! permutations of the integer sequence [n] = 1,2,3,...,n. The i-th permutation, i=1,2,...,n!, consists of Z(i) permutation cycles. Such a cycle has the length lc(i,j), j=1,...,Z(i). For a given permutation we form the product of all its cycle lengths Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j). Furthermore, we sum up all such products for all permutations of [n] which gives Sum_{i=1..n!} Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j) = A000262(n). For n=4 we have Sum_{i=1..n!} Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j) = 1*1*1*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 2*1 + 3*1 + 4 + 3*1 + 4 + 2*2 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 4 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 2*2 + 4 + 2*2 + 4 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 4 = 73 = A000262(4). - _Thomas Wieder_, Oct 06 2006
For a finite set S of size n, a chain gang G of S is a partially ordered set (S,<=) consisting only of chains. The number of chain gangs of S is a(n).

Consider the distribution of n unlabeled elements "1" onto n levels where empty levels are allowed. In addition, the empty levels are labeled. Their names are 0_1, 0_2, 0_3, etc. This sequence gives the total number of such distributions. If the empty levels are unlabeled ("0"), then the answer is A001700. Let the colon ":" separate two levels.

a(n) is the number of acyclic, injective functions from subsets of [n] to [n]. Let subset D of [n] have size k. The number of acyclic, injective functions from D to [n] is (n-1)!/(n-k-1)! and hence a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n-1} binomial(n,k)*(n-1)!/(n-k-1)!. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 05 2015

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of labeled-rooted skinny-tree forests on n nodes. A skinny tree is a tree in which each vertex has at most one child. Let k denote the number of trees. There are binomial(n,k) ways to choose the roots, binomial(n-1,k-1) ways to choose the number of descendants for each root, and (n-k)! ways to permute those descendants. Summing over k, we obtain a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} C(n,k)*C(n-1,k-1)*(n-k)!. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 10 2015
This is the Sheffer transform of the Bell numbers A000110 with the Sheffer matrix S = |Stirling1| = (1, -log(1-x)) = A132393. See the e.g.f. formula, a Feb 21 2017 comment on A048993, and R. Stanley's Jun 07 2010 comment above. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 21 2017

With regard to the tabular presentation described in the comment by Marco Matosic: in his drawing, starting with the 3rd row, the first term in the row, which is equal to 1 (or, alternatively the last term in the row, which is also equal to 1), is not in the actual sequence and is added to the drawing as a fictitious term (for the sake of symmetry); an actual A000265(n) could be considered to be a(j,k) (where j >= 1 is the row number and k>=1 is the column subscript), such that a(j,1) = 1:
  1
  1  3
  1  5  3  7
  1  9  5 11  3 13  7 15
  1 17  9 19  5 21 11 23  3 25 13 27  7 29 15 31
and so on ... .
The relationship between k and j for each row is 1 <= k <= 2^(j-1). In this corrected tabular representation, Marco's notion that "every new row is the previous row interspaced with the continuation of the odd numbers" remains true. (End)
Partitions natural numbers to the same equivalence classes as A064989. That is, for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) <=> A064989(i) = A064989(j).

This sequence is the truncated triangle:
   1,  1;
   3,  1,  5;
   3,  7,  1,  9;
   5, 11,  3, 13,  7;

   7, 29, 15, 31,  1, 33, 17, 35;
  ...
The first column is A069834. The second column is A213671. The main diagonal is A236999. The first upper diagonal is A125650 without 0.
c(n) = ((n*(n+1)/2))/A069834 = 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, ... for n > 0. n*(n+1)/2 is the rank of A069834.
The full triangle beginning with 0 corresponds to the numerators of the Oresme numbers O(n) = a(n-1)*a(n) = A000265(n-1)*A00265(n). (End)
As well as being multiplicative, a(n) is a strong divisibility sequence, that is, gcd(a(n),a(m)) = a(gcd(n,m)) for n, m >= 1. In particular, a(n) is a divisibility sequence: if n divides m then a(n) divides a(m). - _Peter Bala_, Feb 27 2019

Let 2*n!*V(n)=A137886(n) be the number of ways of seating n married couples at 2*n chairs arranged side-by-side in a straight line, men and women in alternate positions, so that no husband is next to his wife.
It is known [Riordan, Ch. 8, Th. 1, t=0] that, if 2*n!*U(n) is a solution of an analogous problem at a circular table, then U(n) = V(n) - V(n-1), n>=3, where U(n) = A000179(n). Thus V(n) = Sum_{i=3,...,n} A000179(i), n>=1, and comparing the initial conditions, we conclude that a(n) = V(n), n>=1. This gives a combinatorial interpretation for 2*n!*a(n).

PROPERTIES: 
Number of spanning trees in complete graph K_n on n labeled nodes.
Robert Castelo (rcastelo(AT)imim.es), Jan 06 2001, observes that n^(n-2) is also the number of transitive subtree acyclic digraphs on n-1 vertices.
a(n) is also the number of ways of expressing an n-cycle in the symmetric group S_n as a product of n-1 transpositions, see example. - Dan Fux (dan.fux(AT)OpenGaia.com or danfux(AT)OpenGaia.com), Apr 12 2001
Also counts parking functions, critical configurations of the chip firing game, allowable pairs sorted by a priority queue [Hamel].
The parking functions of length n can be described as all permutations of all words [d(1),d(2), ..., d(n)] where 1 <= d(k) <= k; see example. There are (n+1)^(n-1) = a(n+1) parking functions of length n. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 15 2014

a(n+1) is the number of length n sequences on an alphabet of {1,2,...,n} that have a partial sum equal to n. For example a(4)=16 because there are 16 length 3 sequences on {1,2,3} in which the terms (beginning with the first term and proceeding sequentially) sum to 3 at some point in the sequence. {1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 1}, {2, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 1, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 1, 3}, {3, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 2}, {3, 2, 3}, {3, 3, 1}, {3, 3, 2}, {3, 3, 3}. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jul 20 2009
a(n) is the number of acyclic functions from {1,2,...,n-1} to {1,2,...,n}. An acyclic function f satisfies the following property: for any x in the domain, there exists a positive integer k such that (f^k)(x) is not in the domain. Note that f^k denotes the k-fold composition of f with itself, e.g., (f^2)(x)=f(f(x)). - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Mar 02 2011
a(n) is the absolute value of the discriminant of the polynomial x^{n-1}+...+x+1. More precisely, a(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)(n-2)/2} times the discriminant. - _Zach Teitler_, Jan 28 2014

a(n) is the number of topologically distinct lines of play for the game Planted Brussels Sprouts on n vertices. See Ji and Propp link. - _Caleb Ji_, May 11 2018
a(n+1) is also the number of bases of R^n, that can be made from the n(n+1)/2 vectors of the form [0 ... 0 1 ... 1 0 ... 0]^T, where the initial or final zeros are optional, but at least one 1 has to be included. - _Nicolas Nagel_, Jul 31 2018

We consider optimal proper vertex colorings of a graph G. Assume that the labeling, i.e., coloring starts with 1. By optimality we mean that the maximum label used is the minimum of the maximum integer label used across all possible labelings of G. Let S=Sum of the differences |l(v) - l(u)|, the sum being over all edges uv of G and l(w) is the label associated with a vertex w of G. We say G admits unique labeling if all possible labelings of G is S-invariant and yields the same integer partition of S.

In physics, a(n)/2 is the trace of the spin operator S_z^2 for a particle with spin S=n/2. For example, when S=3/2, the S_z eigenvalues are -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2 and the sum of their squares is 10/2 = a(3)/2. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Nov 06 2013

For n >= 4, a(n-3) is the number of permutations of 1,2...,n with the distribution of up (1) - down (0) elements 0...0111 (n-4 zeros), or, equivalently, a(n-3) is up-down coefficient {n,7} (see comment in A060351). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 15 2014
a(n) = one-half the area of the region created by plotting the points (n^2,(n+1)^2). A line connects points (n^2,(n+1)^2) and ((n+1)^2, (n+2)^2) and a line is drawn from (0,1) to each increasing point. From (0,1) to (4,9) the area is 2; from (0,1) to (9,16) the area is 8; further areas are 20,40,70,...,2*a(n). - _J. M. Bergot_, May 29 2014

If n is even then a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n/2} (2k)^2. If n is odd then a(n) = Sum_{k=0..(n-1)/2} (1+2k)^2. This can be illustrated as stacking boxes inside a square pyramid on plateaus of edge lengths 2k or 2k+1, respectively. The largest k are the 2k X 2k or (2k+1) X (2k+1) base. - _R. K. Guy_, Feb 26 2015
Draw n lines in general position in the plane. Any three define a triangle, so in all we see C(n,3) =  a(n-2) triangles (6 lines produce 4 triangles, and so on). - Terry Stickels, Jul 21 2015

The formula for p3(n) in the article by S. Finch (page 2) is incomplete, terms with n^(1/2) and n^(1/4) are also needed. These terms are in the article by Mustonen and Rajesh (page 2) and agree with my results, but in both articles the multiplicative constant is marked only as C, resp. c3(m). The following is a closed form of this constant: Pi^(1/24) * exp(1/24 - Zeta(3) / (8*Pi^2) + 75*Zeta(3)^3 / (2*Pi^8)) / (A^(1/2) * 2^(157/96) * 15^(13/96)) = A255939 = 0.213595160470..., where A = A074962 is the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant and Zeta(3) = A002117. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, Mar 11 2015 [The new version of "Integer Partitions" by S.

Decimal integer corresponding to the result of XORing the binary representation of 2^n - 1 and the binary representation of n with leading zeros. This sequence and a few others are syntactically similar. For n > 0, let D(n) denote the decimal integer corresponding to the binary number having n consecutive 1's. Then D(n).OP.n represents the n-th term of a sequence when .OP. stands for a binary operator such as '+', '-', '*', 'quotentof', 'mod', 'choose'. We then get the various sequences A136556, A082495, A082482, A066524, A000295, A052944. Another syntactically similar sequence results when we take the n-th term as f(D(n)).OP.f(n). For example if f='factorial' and .OP.='/', we get (A136556)(A000295) ; if f='squaring' and .OP.='-', we get (A000295)(A052944). - _K.V.Iyer_, Mar 30 2009

The compositions of n in which each natural number is colored by one of p different colors are called p-colored compositions of n. For n >= 1, a(n) equals the number of 5-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color. - _Milan Janjic_, Nov 17 2011

From _Doug Bell_, Jun 22 2015: (Start)
Empirical observation: Where n is an odd multiple of 3, let x = (a(n)+1)/9 and let y = decimal expansion of x/a(n); then y*(x+1)/x + 1 = y rotated to the left.
Example:
  a(3) = 125;
  x = (125+1)/9 = 14;
  y = 112, which is the decimal expansion of 14/125 = 0.112;
  112*(14+1)/14 + 1 = 121 = 112 rotated to the left.

According to Ira Gessel, Dellac's interpretation is the following: start with a 2n X n array of cells and consider the set D of cells in rows i through i+n of column i, for i from 1 to n. Then a(n) is the number of subsets of D containing two cells in each column and one cell in each row.
Barsky proved that for even n>1, a(n) is congruent to 3 mod 4 and for odd n>1, congruent to 2 mod 4. Gessel shows that for even n>5, a(n) is congruent to 4n-1 mod 16 and for odd n>2 that a(n)/2 is congruent to 2-n mod 8.

Inverse binomial transform of A001146.
Number of nondegenerate Boolean functions of n variables.
Twice the number of covers of an n-set (A003465). That is, the number of subsets of an n-element set S whose union is S.
From David P. Moulton, Nov 11 2010: (Start)
To see why the formula in the definition gives the number of covers of an n-set we use inclusion-exclusion.
The set S has n elements and T, the power set of S, has 2^n elements.
Let U be the power set of T; we want to know how many elements of U have union S.
For any element i of S, let U_i be the subset of U whose unions do not contain i, so we want to compute the size of the complement of the union of the U_i s.
Write U_I for the union of U_i for i in I. Then U_I consists of all subsets of T whose union is disjoint from I, so it consists of all subsets of the power set of S - I. The power set of S - I has 2^(n - #I) elements, so U_I has size 2^2^(n - #I).
Then the basic inclusion--exclusion formula says that our answer is
#(U - union_{i in S} U_i) = sum_{I subseteq S} (-1)^#I #U_I = sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j sum{#I = j} #U_I = sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j (n choose j) 2^2^(n-j), as required.
(End)
Here is Comtet's proof: Let P'(S) be the power set of nonempty subsets of S. Then |P'(P'(S)| = 2^(2^n-1)-1 = Sum_k binomial(n,k)*a(k). Apply the inverse binomial transform to get a(n) = Sum_k (-1)^k*binomial(n,k)*2^(2^(n-k)-1). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 19 2011

Suppose the whole deck is now sorted (if not, discard this case). a(n) is the maximal number of steps before 1 got to the top.See also A000375, which is the main entry for this problem.

For some n, there are some longest chains which end up sorted and some which don't, like n = 6, with the following four chains that end sorted and one that does not:

And for some n, e.g. n=12, none of the longest chains end up sorted (and hence A000375 and A000376 are different). I did an exhaustive search with n = 12 working backwards from sorted and found 63 as the longest chain beginning with one of these four:
#(9 10 6 0 2 7 1 8 11 5 3 4)
#(9 10 6 0 1 2 7 8 11 5 3 4)
#(7 8 11 5 0 6 10 9 2 1 3 4)
#(5 0 1 7 10 3 11 8 9 6 2 4)
But 65 is attainable if you don't assume it ends up sorted. (End)

As Beedassy's formula shows, this Hexagonal number sequence is the odd bisection of the Triangle number sequence. Both of these sequences are figurative number sequences.  For A000384, a(n) can be found by multiplying its triangle number by its hexagonal number. For example let's use the number 153. 153 is said to be the 17th triangle number but is also said to be the 9th hexagonal number. Triangle(17) Hexagonal(9). 17*9=153. Because the Hexagonal number sequence is a subset of the Triangle number sequence, the Hexagonal number sequence will always have both a triangle number and a hexagonal number. n* (2*n-1) because (2*n-1) renders the triangle number. - _Bruce J. Nicholson_, Nov 05 2017
Also numbers k with the property that in the symmetric representation of sigma(k) the smallest Dyck path has a central valley and the largest Dyck path has a central peak, n >= 1. Thus all hexagonal numbers > 0 have middle divisors. (Cf. A237593.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 28 2018

Let [m] denote the first m positive integers.

The functions are f1 = {(1,5), (2,5), (3,4), (4,5)}, f2 = {(1,5), (2,3), (3,5), (4,5)}, f3 = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}, f4 = {(1,2), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}, f5 = {(1,3), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}, f6 = {(1,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}. - _Dennis P.

(It is easy to prove that the number of elements in S(n) is the n-th triangular number given by A001952.) See A122554 for a sequence defined in this way. - _John W.

Let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n+1) = the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which x and y are disjoint and for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x. Wieder calls these "disjoint strict 2-combinations". - _Ross La Haye_, Jan 11 2008; corrected by _Ross La Haye_, Oct 29 2008
Also, let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n+2) = the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which either 0) x and y are disjoint and for which either x is a subset of y or y is a subset of x, or 1) x and y are disjoint and for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x, or 2) x and y are intersecting and for which either x is a proper subset of y or y is a proper subset of x. - _Ross La Haye_, Jan 11 2008
3 * a(n+1) = p(n+1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = a(k+1) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 29 2012
John W. Layman's conjecture that a(n+2) is the sum of elements in S(n) follows from the identification of S(n) with the first n rows of A036561, whose row sums are A001047. - _Fred Daniel Kline_, Oct 02 2014
From _M. Sinan Kul_, Sep 08 2016: (Start)
Let m be equal to the product of n-1 distinct primes. Then a(n) is equal to the number of distinct fractions >=1 that may be created by dividing a divisor of m by another divisor. For example for m = 2*3*5 = 30, we would have the following 6 fractions: 6/5, 3/2, 5/3, 5/2, 10/3, 15/2.
Here finding the number of fractions would be equivalent to distributing n-1 balls (distinct primes) to two bins (numerator and denominator) with no empty bins which can be found by Stirling numbers of the second kind. So another definition for a(n) is a(n) = Sum_{i=2..n-1} Stirling2(i,2)*binomial(n-1,i).
Also for n > 0, a(n) = (d(m^2)+1)/2 - d(m) where m is equal to the product of n-1 distinct primes. Example for a(5): m = 2*3*5*7 = 210 (product of four distinct primes) so a(5) = (d(210^2)+1)/2 - d(210) = 41 - 16 = 25. (End)

A number n is abundant if sigma(n) > 2n (cf. A005101), perfect if sigma(n) = 2n (this entry), deficient if sigma(n) < 2n (cf. A005100), where sigma(n) is the sum of the divisors of n (A000203).
The numbers 2^(p-1)(2^p - 1) are perfect, where p is a prime such that 2^p - 1 is also prime (for the list of p's see A000043). There are no other even perfect numbers and it is believed that there are no odd perfect numbers.
Numbers n such that Sum_{d|n} 1/d = 2. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Apr 07 2002
For number of divisors of a(n) see A061645(n). Number of digits in a(n) is A061193(n). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jun 04 2004
All entries other than the first have digital root 1 (since 4^2 == 4 (mod 6), we have, by induction, 4^k == 4 (mod 6), or 2*2^(2*k) = 8 == 2 (mod 6) implying that Mersenne primes M = 2^p - 1, for odd p, are of the form 6*t+1. Thus perfect numbers N, being M-th triangular, have the form (6*t+1)*(3*t+1), whence the property N mod 9 = 1 for all N after the first. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Aug 21 2004
The earliest recorded mention of this sequence is in Euclid's Elements, IX 36, about 300 BC. - _Artur Jasinski_, Jan 25 2006
The number of divisors of a(n) that are powers of 2 is equal to A000043(n), assuming there are no odd perfect numbers. The number of divisors of a(n) that are multiples of n-th Mersenne prime A000668(n) is also equal to A000043(n), again assuming there are no odd perfect numbers. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 28 2008
Theorem (Euclid, Euler). An even number n is a perfect number if and only if n = 2^(k-1)*(2^k-1), where 2^k-1 is prime. Euler's idea came from Euclid's Proposition 36 of Book IX (see Weil). It follows that every even perfect number is also a triangular number. - _Mohammad K. Azarian_, Apr 16 2008

Theorem (_Farideh Firoozbakht_): If m is an integer and both p and p^k-m-1 are prime numbers then x = p^(k-1)*(p^k-m-1) is a solution to the equation sigma(x) = (p*x+m)/(p-1). For example, if we take m=0 and p=2 we get Euclid's result about perfect numbers. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Mar 01 2015
The cototient of the even perfect numbers is square; in particular, if 2^p - 1 is a Mersenne prime, cototient(2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1)) = (2^(p-1))^2. So, this sequence is a subsequence of A063752. - _Bernard Schott_, Jan 11 2019

Catalan conjectured that three times any odd square not divisible by 5 is a sum of squares of three primes other than 2 and 3 (regarding 1 as a prime). Catalan stated and Realis proved that every power of 3 is a sum of three squares relatively prime to 3. [See Dickson]
From the abstract of the Berkovich and Jagy paper: "Let s(n) be the number of representations of n as the sum of three squares. We prove a remarkable new identity for s(p^2n) - ps(n) with p being an odd prime. This identity makes nontrivial use of ternary quadratic forms with discriminants p^2 and 16p^2. To prove this identity we employ the Siegel-Weil and the Smith-Minkowski product formulas."

PROPERTIES: 
a(n) is also the (n,n)-th entry in the inverse of the n-th Hilbert matrix. - Asher Auel (asher.auel(AT)reed.edu), May 20 2001
a(n) is also the ratio of the determinants of the n-th Hilbert matrix to the (n+1)-th Hilbert matrix (see A005249), for n>0. Thus the determinant of the inverse of the n-th Hilbert matrix is the product of a(i) for i from 1 to n. (Claimed by _Jud McCranie_ without proof, Jul 17 2000)
a(n) is the right side of the binomial sum: 2^(4*n) * sum(binomial(-1/2, i)*binomial(1/2, i), i=0..n). - Yong Kong (ykong(AT)curagen.com), Dec 26 2000

Another possible name: Total number of permutations of a set with n elements.
Total number of ordered k-tuples (k=0..n) of distinct elements from an n-element set.
Also the number of one-to-one sequences that can be formed from n distinct objects.
Related to number of operations of addition and multiplication to evaluate a determinant of order n by cofactor expansion - see A026243.
a(n) is also the number of paths (without loops) in the complete graph on n+2 vertices starting at one vertex v1 and ending at another v2. Example: when n=2 there are 5 paths in the complete graph with 4 vertices starting at the vertex 1 and ending at the vertex 2: (12),(132),(142),(1342),(1432) so a(2) = 5. - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Feb 23 2001; comment corrected by Jonathan Coxhead, Mar 21 2003
Also row sums of Table A008279, which can be generated by taking the derivatives of x^k. For example, for y = 1*x^3, y' = 3x^2, y" = 6x, y'''= 6 so a(4) = 1 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 16. - _Alford Arnold_, Dec 15 1999

a(n) is the number of permutations on [n+1] whose left-to-right record lows all occur at the start. Example: a(2) counts all permutations on [3] except 231 (the last entry is a record low but its predecessor is not). - _David Callan_, Jul 20 2005
a(n) = number of permutations on [n+1] that avoid the (scattered) pattern 1-2-3|. The vertical bar means the "3" must occur at the end of the permutation. For example, 21354 is not counted by a(4): 234 is an offending subpermutation. - _David Callan_, Nov 02 2005
Number of deco polyominoes of height n+1 having no reentrant corners along the lower contour (i.e., no vertical step that is followed by a horizontal step). In other words, a(n)=A121579(n+1,0). A deco polyomino is a directed column-convex polyomino in which the height, measured along the diagonal, is attained only in the last column. Example: a(1)=2 because the only deco polyominoes of height 2 are the vertical and horizontal dominoes, having no reentrant corners along their lower contours. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 16 2006

Consider the subsets of the set {1,2,3,...,n} formed by the first n integers. E.g., for n = 3 we have {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. Let the variable sbst denote a subset. For each subset sbst we determine its number of parts, that is nprts(sbst). The sum over all possible subsets is written as Sum_{sbst=subsets}. Then a(n) = Sum_{sbst=subsets} nprts(sbst)!. E.g., for n = 3 we have 1!+1!+1!+1!+2!+2!+2!+3!=16. - _Thomas Wieder_, Jun 17 2006

Number of restricted growth strings (RGS) [d(1),d(2),..,d(n)] such that d(k)<=k and d(k) <= 1 + (number of nonzero digits in prefix). The positions of nonzero digits determine the subset, and their values (decreased by 1) are the (left) inversion table (a rising factorial number) for the permutation, see example. - _Joerg Arndt_, Dec 09 2012
Number of a restricted growth strings (RGS) [d(0), d(1), d(2), ..., d(n)] where d(k)>=0 and d(k) <= 1 + chg([d(0), d(1), d(2), ..., d(k-1)]) and chg(.) gives the number of changes of its argument. Replacing the function chg(.) by a function asc(.) that counts the ascents in the prefix gives A022493 (ascent sequences). - _Joerg Arndt_, May 10 2013

a(n) is the number of ways at most n people can queue up at a (slow) ticket counter when one or more of the people may choose not to queue up. Note that there are C(n,k) sets of k people who quene up and k! ways to queue up. Since k can run from 0 to n, a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} n!/(n-k)! = Sum_{k=0..n}n!/k!. For example, if n=3 and the people are A(dam), B(eth), and C(arl), a(3)=16 since there are 16 possible lineups: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA, AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB, A, B, C, and empty queue. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Oct 02 2015

Arithmetic mean: m(1,c/(c-1)) = (2c+1)/2c; harmonic mean: h(1,c/(c-1)) = 2c/(2c-1);
a(n) is the number of means to reach (n+1)/n from 2/1;
with m for 0 and h for 1, the inverse binary expansion of n, without the leading 1, gives the sequence of means. (End)
As function of the absolute value, defines the minimal Euclidean function v on Z\{0}. A ring R is Euclidean if for some function v : R\{0}->N a division by nonzero b can be defined with remainder r satisfying either r=0 or v(r)<v(b). For the integers taking v(n)=|n| works, but v(n)=floor(log_2(|n|)) works as well; moreover it is the possibility with smallest possible values. For division by b>0 one can always choose |r| <= floor(b/2); this sequence satisfies a(1)=0 and recursively a(n) = 1 + max(a(1), ..., a(floor(n/2))) for n > 1. - _Marc A.

A conjectured definition: Let 0 < a_1 < a_2 <...<a_{2n} < 1. Then how many ways are there in which one can add or subtract all the a_i to get an odd number. For example, take n = 2. Then the options are a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4 = 1 or 3; one can change the sign of any of the a_i's and get 1; or -a_1-a_2+a_3+a_4 = 1. That's a total of 7, which is the 2nd number of this sequence. One of the definitions of the sequence (which was how I came across it) is the degree of the equation giving the area of a cyclic polygon in terms of the sides. I conjectured that for any set of side lengths there is a unique way of fitting them together for any possible winding number and any possible subset of sides which go round the circle in a retrograde manner. - Simon Norton (simon(AT)dpmms.cam.ac.uk), May 14 2001

From _Peter Bala_, Sep 25 2015: (Start)
The simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(a(2*n)) = [10^n; 2*10^n, 2*10^n, ...] has period 1.
The simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(a(6*n))/a(2*n) = [10^n - 1; 1, 10^n - 1, 10^n - 1, 1, 2*(10^n - 1), ...] has period 5.
The simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(a(10*n))/a(2*n) = [10^(3*n) - 10^n; 10^n, 10^n, 2*(10^(3*n) - 10^n), ...] has period 3.
As n increases, these expansions have large partial quotients.
A theorem of Kuzmin in the measure theory of continued fractions says that large partial quotients are the exception in continued fraction expansions.
Empirically, we also see exceptionally large partial quotients in the continued fraction expansions of the m-th root of the numbers a(m*n), for m >= 3. For example, it appears that the continued fraction expansion of a(3*n)^(1/3) begins [10^n; 3*10^(2*n), 10^n, 4.5*10^(2*n), 0.8*10^n, ( 9*10^(2*n + 2) - 144 + 24*(2^mod(n,3) - 1) )/168, ...]. As n increases, the expansion begins with 6 large partial quotients. An example is given below. Cf. A002283, A066138 and  A168624.

From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 11 2013: (Start)
For sums of powers of positive integers S(k,n) := Sum_{j=1..n}j^k one has the recurrence S(k,n) = (n+1)*S(k-1,n) - Sum_{l=1..n} S(k-1,l), n >= 1, k >= 1.
This was used for k=4 by Ibn al-Haytham in an attempt to compute the volume of the interior of a paraboloid. See the Strick reference where the trick he used is shown, and the W. Lang link.
This trick generalizes immediately to arbitrary powers k. For k=3: a(n) = (n+1)*A000330(n) - Sum_{l=1..n} A000330(l), which coincides with the formula given in the previous comment by Berselli. (End)

Draw a regular hexagon. Construct points on each side of the hexagon such that these points divide each side into equally sized segments (i.e., a midpoint on each side or two points on each side placed to divide each side into three equally sized segments or so on), do the same construction for every side of the hexagon so that each side is equally divided in the same way. Connect all such points to each other with lines that are parallel to at least one side of the polygon. The result is a triangular tiling of the hexagon and the creation of a number of smaller regular hexagons. The equation gives the total number of regular hexagons found where n = the number of points drawn + 1. For example, if 1 point is drawn on each side then n = 1 + 1 = 2 and a(n) = 2^3 = 8 so there are 8 regular hexagons in total. If 2 points are drawn on each side then n = 2 + 1 = 3 and a(n) = 3^3 = 27 so there are 27 regular hexagons in total. - Noah Priluck (npriluck(AT)gmail.com), May 02 2007

We construct a number triangle from the integers 1, 2, 3, ... 2*n-1 as follows. The first column contains all the integers 1, 2, 3, ... 2*n-1. Each succeeding column is the same as the previous column but without the first and last items. The last column contains only n. The sum of all the numbers in the triangle is n^3.

It is conjectured that tau(n) is never zero (this has been verified for n < 816212624008487344127999, see the Derickx, van Hoeij, Zeng reference).
M. J. Hopkins mentions that the only known primes p for which tau(p) == 1 (mod p) are 11, 23 and 691, that it is an open problem to decide if there are infinitely many such p and that no others are known below 35000. Simon Plouffe has now searched up to tau(314747) and found no other examples. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 25 2007
Number 1 of the 74 eta-quotients listed in Table I of Martin (1996).
With Dedekind's eta function and the discriminant Delta one has eta(z)^24 = Delta(z)/(2*Pi)^12 = Sum_{m >= 1} tau(m)*q^m, with q = exp(2*Pi*i*z), and z in the complex upper half plane, where i is the imaginary unit. Delta is the eigenfunction of the Hecke operator T_n (n >= 1) with eigenvalue tau(n): T_n Delta = tau(n) Delta. From this the formula for tau(m)*tau(n) given below in the formula section follows. See, e.g., the Koecher-Krieg reference, Lemma and Satz, p. 212. Or the Apostol reference, eq. (3) on p. 114 and the first part of section 6.13 on p. 131. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 26 2016

PROPERTIES: 
Number of unlabeled rooted trees in which each node has out-degree <= 3.
Ignoring stereoisomers means that the children of a node are unordered. They can be permuted in any way and it is still the same tree. See A000625 for the analogous sequence with stereoisomers counted.
In alkanes every carbon has valence exactly 4 and every hydrogen has valence exactly 1. But the trees considered here are just the carbon "skeletons" (with all the hydrogen atoms stripped off) so now each carbon bonds to 1 to 4 other carbons. The out-degree is then <= 3.
Other descriptions of this sequence: quartic planted trees with n nodes; ternary rooted trees with n nodes and height at most 3.
The number of aliphatic amino acids with n carbon atoms in the side chain, and no rings or double bonds, has the same growth as this sequence. - _Konrad Gruetzmann_, Aug 13 2012

From _Thomas Wieder_, Feb 11 2007: (Start)
If P(i,k) denotes the number of integer partitions of i into k parts and if k=3, then a(n) = Sum_{i=k..n+2} P(i,k). See also A002620 = Quarter-squares, this sequence follows for k=2 as pointed out by _Rick L. Shepherd_, Feb 27 2004.
For example, a(n=6)=16 because there are 16 integer partitions of n=3,4,...,n+2=8 with k=3 parts:
[[1, 1, 1]],
[[2, 1, 1]],
[[3, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1]]
[[4, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2]],
[[5, 1, 1], [4, 2, 1], [3, 3, 1], [3, 2, 2]],
[[6, 1, 1], [5, 2, 1], [4, 3, 1], [4, 2, 2], [3, 3, 2]]. (End)
Let P(i,k) be the number of integer partitions of n into k parts. Then if k=3 we have a(n) = Sum_{i=k..n} P(i,k=3). - _Thomas Wieder_, Feb 20 2007

PROPERTIES: 
Nodes are unlabeled, each node has out-degree <= 3.
Steric, or including stereoisomers, means that the children of a node are taken in a certain cyclic order. If the children are rotated it is still the same tree, but any other permutation yields a different tree. See A000598 for the analogous sequence with stereoisomers not counted.
Other descriptions of this sequence: steric planted trees with n nodes; total number of monosubstituted alkanes C(n)H(2n+1)-X with n carbon atoms.

PROPERTIES: 
Trees are unrooted; nodes are unlabeled and have degree <= 4.
Regarding stereoisomers as different means that only the alternating group A_4 acts at each node, not the full symmetric group S_4. See A000602 for the analogous sequence when stereoisomers are not counted as different.
Has also been described as steric planted trees (paraffins) with n nodes.

This is the sequence of cumulants of the probability distribution of the number of tails before the first head in a sequence of fair coin tosses. - Michael Hardy (hardy(AT)math.umn.edu), May 01 2005
Appears to be row sums of A154921. - _Mats Granvik_, Jan 18 2009
This is the number of cyclically ordered partitions of n+1 labeled points. The ordered version is A000670. - _Michael Somos_, Jan 08 2011
A000670(n+1) = p(n+1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = a(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 27 2012
Row sums of A154921 as conjectured above by Granvik. a(n) gives the number of outcomes of a race between n horses H1,...,Hn, where if a horse falls it is not ranked. For example, when n = 2 the 6 outcomes are a dead heat, H1 wins H2 second, H2 wins H1 second, H1 wins H2 falls, H2 wins H1 falls or both fall. - _Peter Bala_, May 15 2012
Also the number of disjoint areas of a Venn diagram for n multisets. - _Aurelian Radoaca_, Jun 27 2016
Also the number of ways of ordering n nonnegative integers, allowing for the possibility of ties, and also comparing the smallest integers with 0. Each comparison with 0 gives two possibilities, x > 0 or x=0. As such, without comparison with 0, we get A000670, the number of ways of ordering n nonnegative integers, allowing for the possibility of ties, or the number of ways n competitors can rank in a competition, allowing for the possibility of ties. For instance, for 2 nonnegative integers x,y, there are the following 6 ways of ordering them: x = y = 0, x = y > 0, x > y = 0, x > y > 0, y > x = 0, y > x > 0. - _Aurelian Radoaca_, Jul 09 2016
Also the number of ordered set partitions of subsets of {1,...,n}. Also the number of chains of distinct nonempty subsets of {1,...,n}. - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 01 2019

All prime numbers p can be classified by k = (p mod 12) into four classes: k=1, 5, 7, 11. The Mersennne prime numbers 2^p-1, p > 2 are in the class k=7 with p=12*(n-1)+7, n=1,2,.... As all 2^p (p odd) are in class k=8 it follows that all 2^p-1, p > 2 are in class k=7. - _Freimut Marschner_, Jul 27 2013
From "The Guinness Book of Primes": "During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the largest known prime number was the number of grains of rice on the chessboard up to and including the nineteenth square: 524,287 [= 2^19 - 1]. By the time Lord Nelson was fighting the Battle of Trafalgar, the record for the largest prime had gone up to the thirty-first square of the chessboard: 2,147,483,647 [= 2^31 - 1]. This ten-digits number was proved to be prime in 1772 by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler, and it held the record until 1867." [du Sautoy] - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Nov 26 2013

Number of ways that 2n people of different heights can be arranged (for a photograph) in two rows of equal length so that every person in the front row is shorter than the person immediately behind them in the back row.
a(n) is the number of functions f:[n]->[n^2] such that, if floor((f(x))^.5) = floor((f(y))^.5), then x = y. For example, with n = 4, the range of f consists of one element from each of the four sets {1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7,8}, {9,10,11,12,13,14,15}, and {16}. Hence there are 1*3*5*7 = 105 ways to choose the range for f, and there are 4! ways to injectively map {1,2,3,4} to the four elements of the range. Thus there are 105*24 = 2520 such functions. Note also that a(n) = n!*(product of the first n odd numbers). - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 28 2012
a(n) is also the 2*n th difference of n-powers of A000217 (triangular numbers). For example a(2) is the 4th difference of the squares of triangular numbers. - _Enric Reverter i Bigas_, Jun 24 2013
a(n) is the multinomial coefficient (2*n) over (2, 2, 2, ..., 2) where there are n 2's in the last parenthesis. It is therefore also the number of words of length 2n obtained with n letters, each letter appearing twice. - _Robert FERREOL_, Jan 14 2018

Number of ways to fold a strip of n labeled stamps with leaf 1 on top. [Clarified by _Stéphane Legendre_, Apr 09 2013]
From _Roger Ford_, Jul 04 2014: (Start)
The number of semi-meander solutions for n (a(n)) is equal to the number of n top arch solutions in the intersection of A001263 (with no intersecting top arches) and A244312 (arches forming a complete loop).
The top and bottom arches for semi-meanders pass through vertices 1-2n on a straight line with the arches below the line forming a rainbow pattern.
The number of total arches going from an odd vertex to a higher even vertex must be exactly 2 greater than the number of arches going from an even vertex to a higher odd vertex to form a single complete loop with no intersections.
The arch solutions in the intersection of A001263 (T(n,k)) and A244312 (F(n,k)) occur when the number of top arches going from a odd vertex to a higher even vertex (k) meets the condition that k = ceiling((n+1)/2).
Example: semi-meanders a(5)=10.

Equivalently, number of Abelian groups with n conjugacy classes. - _Michael Somos_, Aug 10 2010
a(n) depends only on prime signature of n (cf. A025487). So a(24) = a(375) since 24 = 2^3*3 and 375 = 3*5^3 both have prime signature (3, 1).
Also number of rings with n elements that are the direct product of fields; these are the commutative rings with n elements having no nilpotents; likewise the commutative rings where for every element x there is a k > 0 such that x^(k+1) = x. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Oct 20 2006
Range is A033637.
a(n) = 1 if and only if n is from A005117 (squarefree numbers). See the Ahmed Fares comment there, and the formula for n>=2 below. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 09 2012
Also, from a theorem of Molnár (see [Molnár]), the number of (non-isomorphic) abelian groups of order 2*n + 1 is equal to the number of non-congruent lattice Z-tilings of R^n by crosses, where a "cross" is a unit cube in R^n for which at each facet is attached another unit cube (Z, R are the integers and reals, respectively).

The infinite product over k (here) is the number of representations n=product_i (b_i)^(e_i) where all exponents e_i are distinct and >=1. Examples: a(n=4)=2: 4^1 = 2^2. a(n=8)=3: 8^1 = 2^1*2^2 = 2^3. a(n=9)=2: 9^1 = 3^2. a(n=12)=2: 12^1 = 3*2^2. a(n=16)=5: 16^1 = 2*2^3 = 4^2 = 2^2*4^1 = 2^4. If the e_i are the set {1,2} we get A046951, the number of representations as a product of a number and a square. - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 05 2016

Numbers n such that sum of base 2 digits of n = sum of base 4 digits of n. - _Clark Kimberling_
Numbers having the same representation in both binary and negabinary (A039724). - _Eric W. Weisstein_
This sequence has many other interesting and useful properties. Every integer n corresponds to a unique pair i,j with n=a(i)+2a(j) (i=A059905(n), j=A059906(n)) - see A126684. Every list of numbers L=[L1,L2,L3...] can be encoded uniquely by "recursive binary interleaving", where f(L)=a(L1)+2*a(f([L2,L3...])) with f([])=0. - _Marc LeBrun_, Feb 07 2001
This may be described concisely using the "rebase" notation b[n]q, which means "replace b with q in the expansion of n", thus "rebasing" n from base b into base q. The present sequence is 2[n]4. Many interesting operations (e.g., 10[n](1/10) = digit reverse, shifted) are nicely expressible this way. Note that q[n]b is (roughly) inverse to b[n]q. It's also natural to generalize the idea of "basis" so as to cover the likes of F[n]2, the so-called "fibbinary" numbers (A003714) and provide standard ready-made images of entities obeying other arithmetics, say like GF2[n]2 (e.g., primes = A014580, squares = the present sequence, etc.). - _Marc LeBrun_, Mar 24 2005

For example UDUD contributes 4 labeled paths--0D0D, 0D1D, 1D0D, 1D1D where upsteps are replaced by their labels--and UUDD contributes 6 labeled paths to a(3)=10. The Deléham (Mar 24 2007) formula below counts these labeled paths by number of "0" labels. - _David Callan_, Aug 23 2011
a(n) is the number of indecomposable perfect matchings on [2n]. A perfect matching on [2n] is decomposable if a nonempty subset of the edges forms a perfect matching on [2k] for some k<n; otherwise it is indecomposable. For example, the perfect matching 1-2,3-4 is decomposable, and a(2) = 2 counts 1-3,2-4 and 1-4,2-3. - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2012
From _Robert Coquereaux_, Sep 12 2014: (Start)
QED diagrams are graphs with two kinds of edges (lines): a (non-oriented), f (oriented), and only one kind of (internal) vertex: aff. They may have internal and external (i.e., pendant) lines. The order is the number of (internal) vertices. Vanishing diagrams: QED diagrams containing loops of type f with an odd number of vertices are set to 0 (Furry theorem). Proper diagrams: connected QED diagrams that remain connected when an arbitrary internal line is cut.
The number of Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator (2-point function of QED), vanishing or not, proper or not, of order 2n, starting from n = 0, is given by 1, 2, 10, 74, 706, 8162, ..., i.e., this sequence A000698, with the first term (equal to 1) dropped. Call Sf the associated g.f.
The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, for the same 2-point function, is given by 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ..., i.e., by the sequence A005411, with a first term of order 0, equal to 1, added. Call S the associated g.f.
If one does not remove the vanishing diagram, but, at the same time, considers only those graphs that are proper, one obtains the Feynman diagrams (vanishing and non-vanishing) for the self-energy function of QED, 0, 1, 3, 21, 207, 2529, ..., i.e., the sequence A115974 with a first term of order 0, equal to 0, added. A115974 is twice A167872. Call Sigmaf the associated g.f.
If one removes the vanishing diagrams and, at the same time, considers only those graphs that are proper, one obtains the Feynman diagrams for the self-energy function of QED given by 0, 1, 3, 18, 153, 1638, ..., i.e., by the sequence A005412, with a first term of order 0, equal to 0, added. Call Sigma the associated g.f.
Then Sf = 1/(1-Sigmaf) and S = 1/(1-Sigma). (End)

Number 51 of the 74 eta-quotients listed in Table I of Martin (1996).
Ramanujan (see the link, pp. 155 and 157 Nr. 23.) conjectured the expansion coefficients called Psi_4(n) of eta^4(6*z) in powers of q = exp(2*Pi*i*z), Im(z) > 0, where i is the imaginary unit. In the Finch link on p. 5, multiplicity is used and Psi_4(p^r), called f(p^r), is given (see also b(p^e) formula given by M. Somos, Aug 23 2006). Mordell proved this conjecture on pp. 121-122 based on Klein-Fricke, Theorie der elliptischen Modulfunktionen, 1892, Band II, p. 374. The product formula for the Dirichlet series, Mordell, eq. (7) for a=2,is used to find Psi_4(n), called f_2(n), from f_2(p) for primes p. The primes p = 2 and 3 do not appear in the product. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 03 2016

From _R. K. Guy_, Oct 22 2004: (Start)
I got the no-three-in-line problem from Heilbronn over 50 years ago. See Section F4 in UPINT.
In Canad. Math. Bull. 11 (1968) 527-531, MR 39 #129, Guy & Kelly conjecture that, for large n, at most (c + eps)n points can be selected, where 3c^3 = 2Pi^2 i.e. c ~ 1.87.
As recently as last March, Gabor Ellmann pointed out an error in our heuristic reasoning, which, when corrected, gives 3c^2 = Pi^2, or c ~ 1.813799. (End)

Numbers of the form 3^n, 2*3^n, 4*3^n with a(0) = 1 prepended.
If a set of positive numbers has sum n, this is the largest value of their product.
In other words, maximum of products of partitions of n: maximal value of Product k_i for any way of writing n = Sum k_i. To find the answer, take as many of the k_i's as possible to be 3 and then use one or two 2's (see formula lines below).
a(n) is also the maximal size of an Abelian subgroup of the symmetric group S_n. For example when n = 6, one of the Abelian subgroups with maximal size is the subgroup generated by (123) and (456), which has order 9. [Bercov and Moser] - Ahmed Fares (ahmedfares(AT)my-deja.com), Apr 19 2001

Grantham mentions that he computed a(n) for n <= 500000.
An easy lower bound is a(n) >= A002110(max{ m | A007504(m) <= n}), with strict inequality if n is not in A007504 (sum of the first m primes). Indeed, if A007504(m) <= n, the partition of n into the first m primes and maybe one additional term will have an LCM greater than or equal to primorial(m). If n > A007504(m) then a(n) >= 3/2 A002110(m) by replacing the initial 2 by 3. But even for n = A007504(m), one has a(n) > A002110(m) for m > 8, since replacing 2+23 in 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 by 16+9, one has an LCM of 8*3*primorial(8) > primorial(9) because 24 > 23. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 29 2015
Maximum degree of the splitting field of a polynomial of degree n over a finite field, since over a finite field the degree of the splitting field is the least common multiple of the degrees of the irreducible polynomial factors of the polynomial. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 27 2015

Also the area under the peak-shaped even function f(x)=1/cosh(x). Proof: for the upper half of the integral, write f(x) = (2*exp(-x))/(1+exp(-2x)) = 2*Sum_{k>=0} (-1)^k*exp(-(2k+1)*x) and integrate term by term from zero to infinity.

From _Daniel Forgues_, Mar 20 2015: (Start)
An interesting anecdote about the base-10 representation of Pi, with 3 (integer part) as first (index 1) digit:
  358 0
  359 3
  360 6
  361 0
  362 0
And the circle is customarily subdivided into 360 degrees (although Pi radians yields half the circle)...
(End)
Sometimes referred to as Archimedes's constant, because the Greek mathematician computed lower and upper bounds of Pi by drawing regular polygons inside and outside a circle. In Germany it was called the Ludolphian number until the early 20th century after the Dutch mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen (1540-1610) who calculated up to 35 digits of Pi in the late 16th century. - _Martin Renner_, Sep 07 2016

a(p^k) == k+1 mod p for all primes p. This is proved by Kizmaz at On The Number Of Topologies On A Finite Set link. For proof see Theorem 2.4 in page 2 and 3. So a(19) == 2 mod 19.
a(p+n) == A265042(n) mod p for all primes p. This is also proved by Kizmaz at related link, see Theorem 2.7 in page 4. If n=2 and p=17, a(17+2) == A265042(2) mod 17, that is a(19) == 51 mod 17. So a(19) is divisible by 17.
In conclusion, a(19) is a number of the form 323*n - 17.

A signed permutation is a sequence (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) of integers such that {|x_1|,|x_2|,...|x_n|} = {1,2...,n}. Let x_1,...,x_n be a signed permutation. Then we say 0,x_1,...,x_n,0 is a snake of type S(n;0,0) when 0 < x_1 > x_2 < ... 0. For example, 0 4 -3 -1 -2 0 is a snake of type S(4;0,0). Then a(n) equals the cardinality of S(n;0,0) [Verges]. An example is given below. - _Peter Bala_, Sep 02 2011

a(n) = number of walks of 2n unit steps North, East, South, or West, starting at the origin, bounded above by y=x, below by y=-x and terminating on the ray y=x>=0. Example: a(1) counts EN, EW; a(2) counts ESNN, ESNW, ENSN, ENSW, ENEN, ENEW, EENN, EENW, EEWN, EEWW, EWEN, EWEW. - _David Callan_, Oct 11 2005
Bijective proof: given such a NESW walk, construct a pair (P_1, P_2) of lattice paths of upsteps U=(1,1) and downsteps D=(1,-1) as follows. To get P_1, replace each E and S with U and each W and N with D. To get P_2, replace each N and E with U and each S and W with D. For example, EENSNW -> (UUDUDD, UUUDUD). This mapping is 1-to-1 and its range is the Cartesian product of the set of Dyck n-paths and the set of nonnegative paths of length 2n. The Dyck paths are counted by the Catalan number C_n (A000108) and the nonnegative paths are counted (see for example the Callan link) by the central binomial coefficient binom(2n,n) (A000984). So this is a bijection from these NESW walks to a set of size C_n*binomial(2n,n)=a(n). - _David Callan_, Sep 18 2007

a(n) is equal to the n-th moment of the following positive function defined on x in (0,16), in Maple notation: (EllipticK(sqrt(1-x/16)) - EllipticE(sqrt(1-x/16)))/(Pi^2*sqrt(x)). This is the solution of the Hausdorff moment problem and thus it is unique. - _Karol A. Penson_, Feb 11 2011

a(n) is number of pairs of non-intersecting lattice paths from (0,0) to (n+1,n+1) using (1,0) and (0,1) as steps. Here, non-intersecting means two paths do not share a vertex except the origin and the destination. For example, a(1) = 3 because we have three such pairs from (0,0) to (2,2): {NNEE,EENN}, {NNEE,ENEN}, {NENE,EENN}. - _Ran Pan_, Oct 01 2015

Appears in Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions of signature 4.
H. A. Verrill proves that a(n) = Sum_{p + q + r = 3n} w^(p-q) * {(3n)!/(p! q! r!)}^2, with p, q, r >= 0 and w = primitive 3rd root of unity.
The family of elliptic curves "x=2*H1=p^2+q^2-(1/4)*q^4, 0<x<1" generates these a_n as the coefficients of the period-energy function "T(x)=2*Pi*2F1(1/4,3/4;1;x)". Applying complex transformation "q->sqrt(-1)*q" to H1 produces "x=2*H2=p^2-q^2-(1/4)*q^4, 0<x<1", with "T(x)=sqrt(2)*Pi*2F1(1/4,3/4;1;1-x)". This explains the appearance of factor sqrt(2)/2 in Ramanujan's nome q_1. - _Bradley Klee_, Feb 25 2018

For n >= 1, a(n) is also the sum of the degrees of the irreducible representations of the group of n X n signed permutation matrices (described in sequence A066051). The similar sum for the "ordinary" symmetric group S_n is in sequence A000085. - Sharon Sela (sharonsela(AT)hotmail.com), Jan 12 2002
It appears that this is also the number of permutations of 1, 2, ..., n+1 such that each term (after the first) is within 2 of some preceding term. Verified for n+1 <= 6. E.g., a(4) = 20 because of the 24 permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, the only ones not permitted are 1, 4, 2, 3; 1, 4, 3, 2; 4, 1, 2, 3; and 4, 1, 3, 2. - _Gerry Myerson_, Aug 06 2003

Number of functions f from [n+2] to [n+2] with f(x)=x for exactly n elements x of [n+2] and f(x)>x for exactly two elements x of [n+2]. To prove this, let the two elements of [n+2] with a larger image be labeled i and j. Note both i and j must be less than n+2. Then there are (n+2-i) choices for f(i) and (n+2-j) choices for f(j). Summing the product of the number of choices over all sets {i,j} gives us "Sum of product of unordered pairs of numbers from {1..n+1}" in the first line of the Comments Section.

a(n) is the number of branches of a complete binary tree of n levels. - _Denis Lorrain_, Dec 16 2011
For n>=1, a(n) is the number of length-n words on alphabet {1,2,3} such that the gap(w)=1.  For a word w the gap g(w) is the number of parts missing between the minimal and maximal elements of w.  Generally for words on alphabet {1,2,...,m} with g(w)=g>0 the e.g.f. is: Sum_{k=g+2..m} (m - k + 1)*binomial((k - 2),g)*(exp(x) - 1)^(k - g).  a(3)=6 because we have: 113, 131, 133, 311, 313, 331. Cf. A240506. See the Heubach/Mansour reference. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Apr 13 2014

PROPERTIES: 
There are many equivalent definitions of these numbers. Based on Cox, Theorem 3.22 and Proposition 3.24 and a comment by Eric Rains (rains(AT)caltech.edu), we can say that a positive number n belongs to this sequence if and only if any of the following equivalent statements are true:
(1) Let m > 1 be an odd number relatively prime to n which can be written in the form x^2 + n*y^2 with x, y relatively prime. If the equation m = x^2 + n*y^2 has only one solution with x, y >= 0, then m is a prime number. [Euler]
(2) Every genus of quadratic forms of discriminant -4n consists of a single class. [Gauss]
(3) If a*x^2 + b*x*y + c*y^2 is a reduced quadratic form of discriminant -4n, then either b=0, a=b or a = c. [Cox]
(4) Two quadratic forms of discriminant -4n are equivalent if and only if they are properly equivalent. [Cox]
(5) The class group C(-4n) is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^m for some integer m. [Cox]
(6) n is not of the form ab+ac+bc with 0 < a < b < c. (See proof in link below.)  [Rains]

Note that for n in this sequence, n+1 is either a prime, twice a prime, the square of a prime, 8 or 16. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 08 2004.

"The pioneering mathematician Kummer, over the period 1847-1850, used his profound theory of cyclotomic fields to establish a certain class of primes called 'regular' primes. ... It is known that there exist an infinity of irregular primes; in fact it is a plausible conjecture that only an asymptotic fraction 1/Sqrt(e) ~ 0.6 of all primes are regular." [Ribenboim]

One direction of a bijection between both sorts of partitions, as an algorithm: take a partition P (p(1)+p(2)+...+p(m) such that 2*p(k) <= p(k-1), m is the number of parts), subtract 1 from p(m), 2 from p(m-1), 4 from p(m-2), etc. (this gives a valid partition of the same type), add the part 2^m-1 to the other (initially empty) partition P', repeat until P is empty. The other direction goes by splitting parts 2^k-1 (uniquely) into distinct powers of 2 that are (in decreasing order) added at the left. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 06 2013

a(0) = 4 is the celebrated four-color theorem.
"In 1890 P. Heawood discovered the formula ... and proved that the number of colors required to color a map on an n-holed torus (n >= 1) is at most Chi(n). In 1968 G. Ringel and J. W. T. Youngs succeeded in showing that for every n>=1, there is a configuration of Chi(n) countries on an n-holed torus such that each country shares a border with each of the Chi(n)-1 other countries; this shows that Chi(n) colors may be necessary. This completed the proof that Heawood's formula is indeed the correct chromatic number function for the n-holed torus." ... "Heawood's formula is in fact valid for n = 0." - Stan Wagon

"Does the sequence ... contain every prime? ... [It] was considered by Guy and Nowakowski and later by Shanks, [Wagstaff 1993] computed the sequence through the 43rd term. The computational problem inherent in continuing the sequence further is the enormous size of the numbers that must be factored. Already the number a(1)* ... *a(43) + 1 has 180 digits." - Crandall and Pomerance
If this variant of Euclid-Mullin sequence is initiated either with 3, 7 or 43 instead of 2, then from a[5] onwards it is unchanged. See also A051614. - _Labos Elemer_, May 03 2004
Wilfrid Keller informed me that a(1)* ... *a(43) + 1 was factored as the product of two primes on Mar 09 2010 by the GNFS method. See the post in the Mersenne Forum for more details. The smaller 68-digit prime is a(44). Terms a(45)-a(47) were easy to find. Finding a(48) will require the factorization of a 256-digit number. See the b-file for the four new terms. - _T. D.

Row-sum of signed Catalan triangle A009766. - _Wouter Meeussen_
There are two schools of thought about the best indexing for these numbers. Deutsch and Shapiro have a(4) = 6 whereas here a(5) = 6. The formulas given here use both labelings.
From D. G. Rogers, Oct 18 2005: (Start)
I notice that you have some other zero-one evaluations of binary bracketings (such as A055395). But if you have an operation # with 0#0 = 1#0 = 1, 0#1 = 1#1 = 0, and look at the number of bracketings of a string of n 0's that come out 0, you get another instance of the Fine numbers.
For Z = 1 + x(ZW + WW) = 1 + x CW and W = x(ZZ + ZW) = xZC. Hence Z = 1 + xxCCZ, the functional equational for the g.f. of the Fine numbers. Indeed, C = Z + W = Z + xCZ.
In terms of rooted planar trees with root of even degree, this says that of all rooted planar trees, some have root of even degree (Z) and some have root of odd degree (xCZ). (End)

Let P(x) = x/(1+x) with comp. inverse Pinv(x) = x/(1-x) = -P[-x], and C(x)= [1-sqrt(1-4x)]/2, an o.g.f. for the shifted Catalan numbers A000108, with inverse Cinv(x) = x * (1-x).
Fin(x) = P[C(x)] = C(x)/[1 + C(x)] is an o.g.f. for the Fine numbers, A000957 with inverse Fin^(-1)(x) = Cinv[Pinv(x)] = Cinv[-P(-x)] = (x-2x^2)/(1-x)^2, and Fin(Cinv(x)) =  P(x).
Mot(x) = C[P(x)] = C[-Pinv(-x)] gives an o.g.f. for shifted A005043, the Motzkin or Riordan numbers with comp. inverse Mot^(-1)(x) = Pinv[Cinv(x)] = (x - x^2) / (1 - x + x^2) (cf. A057078).
BTC(x) = C[Pinv(x)] gives A007317, a binomial transform of the Catalan numbers, with BTC^(-1)(x) = P[Cinv(x)] = (x-x^2) / (1 + x - x^2).
Fib(x) = -Fin[Cinv(Cinv(-x))] = -P[Cinv(-x)] = x + 2 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 5 x^4 + ... = (x+x^2)/[1-x-x^2] is an o.g.f. for the shifted Fibonacci sequence A000045, so the comp. inverse is Fib^(-1)(x) = -C[Pinv(-x)] = -BTC(-x) and Fib(x) = -BTC^(-1)(-x).
Generalizing to P(x,t) = x /(1 + t*x) and Pinv(x,t) = x /(1 - t*x) = -P(-x,t) gives other relations to lattice paths, such as the o.g.f. for A091867, C[P[x,1-t]], and that for A104597, Pinv[Cinv(x),t+1].

PROPERTIES: 
Of course 1 = p^0 for any prime p, so 1 is definitely the power of a prime.
The term "prime power" is ambiguous. To a mathematician it means any number p^k, p prime, k >= 0, including 1.
Any nonzero integer is a product of primes and units, where the units are +1 and -1. This is tied to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic which proves that the factorizations are unique up to order and units. (So, since 1 = p^0 does not have a well defined prime base p, it is sometimes not regarded as a prime power. See A246655 for the sequence without 1.)
These numbers are (apart from 1) the numbers of elements in finite fields. - _Franz Vrabec_, Aug 11 2004

1) Denote by {n, k} the number of permutations of 1, ..., n with the up-down index k (for definition, see comment in A203827). Then max_k{n, k} = {n, a(n)} = A000111(n).

Represented in binary form each term after the second one contains every previous term as a substring.
The terms a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 5 are the only primes. Proof: For even n we get a(n) = 2*(2^(2n) - 1)/3, which shows that a(n) is even, too, and obviously a(n) > 2 for all even n > 2. For odd n we have a(n) = (2^(n+1) - 1)/3 = (2^((n+1)/2) - 1) * (2^((n+1)/2) + 1)/3. Evidently, at least one of these factors is divisible by 3, both are greater than 6, provided n > 3. Hence it follows that a(n) is composite for all odd n > 3.
Represented as a binary number, a(n+1) has exactly n prime substrings. Proof: Evidently, a(1) = 1_2 has zero and a(2) = 10_2 has 1 prime substring. Let n > 1. Written in binary, a(n+1) is 101010101...01 (if n + 1 is odd) and is 101010101...10 (if n + 1 is even) with n + 1 digits. Only the 2- and 3-digits substrings 10_2 (=2) and 101_2 (=5) are prime substrings. All the other substrings are nonprime since every substring is a previous term and all terms unequal to 2 and 5 are nonprime. For even n + 1, the number of prime substrings equal to 2 = 10_2 is (n+1)/2, and the number of prime substrings equal to 5 = 101_2 is (n-1)/2, makes a sum of n. For odd n + 1 we get n/2 for both, the number of 2's and 5's prime substrings, in any case, the sum is n.

The same sequence arises in the triangular array of the integers >= 1, according to a simple "zig-zag" rule for selection of terms. a(n-1) lies in the (n-1)-th row of the array, and the second row of that sub-array (with apex a(n-1)) contains just two numbers, one odd, one even. The one with opposite parity to a(n-1) is a(n). - _David James Sycamore_, Jul 29 2018

NAME: In the game described in the Wikipedia link, with n players, the optimal strategy wins with probability 1-a(n)/2^n. In the optimal strategy, the players first agree on a minimal covering code of length n. After the hats are placed, each player knows two words of length n such that one of them is the hat colors of the n players. If one of these two words is a member of the covering code and the other word is not, that player guesses the word that is not. Otherwise, that player does not guess. This strategy guarantees that the team wins for all words that are not members of the covering code.

a(n) = number of (unlabeled, rooted) ordered trees on n-1 vertices in which all outdegrees are <= 2 and, for each vertex of outdegree 2, the sizes of its two subtrees are weakly increasing left to right (n >= 2). The number b(n) of such trees on n vertices satisfies the recurrence b[1]=1; b[n_]/;n>=2 := b[n] = b[n-1] + Sum_{i=1..floor((n-1)/2)} b[i]b[n-1-i], the first term counting trees whose root has outdegree 1 and the sum counting trees whose root has outdegree 2 by size of the left subtree. This recurrence generates b(n) = a(n+1), n >= 1. For example, the a(5)=3 such trees are:
.|....|...../\..
.|.../.\.....|..

From _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 27 2009: (Start)
The connection with the Rayleigh polynomials Phi(2n,x) of A158616 is that Phi(2n,x) = Sum_{i=1..a(n)} 2^(n_i) Product_{j=2..n-1} (x+j)^(n_ij), as described by Kishore.
So a(n) counts the terms in the representation of the polynomial Phi(2n,x) as a sum over these "base" polynomials.
For example, Phi(12,x) = 2^4*(x+2)^2*(x+3) + 2^2*(x+2)*(x+3)^2 + 2^3*(x+2)*(x+3)*(x+4) + 2^3*(x+2)*(x+3)*(x+5) + 2^2*(x+2)*(x+4)*(x+5) + 2*(x+3)^2*(x+5) has a(6)=6 terms. (End)
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 06 2012: (Start)
The o.g.f. G(x) := Sum_{n>=0} a(n)*x^n, with a(0)=0, satisfies the relation (G(x))^2 - 2*G(x) + G2(x^2) + 2*x = 0, with the o.g.f. G2(x) := Sum_{n>=0} a(n)^2*x^n of the squares. This can be proved from the connection to the half-convolution of the sequence with itself (for this notion see a comment on A201204, where also the rule for the o.g.f. is given). (End)
From _Stanislav Sykora_, Oct 13 2014: (Start)
For n > 1, a(n) is the number of rooted binary trees with n leaves or, equivalently, the number of rooted binary trees with n-1 internal vertices.
Also, a symmetric binary operation f(x,y) = f(y,x) can be used to form at most a(n) non-equivalent expressions over n distinct arguments (when f(x,y) has additional properties such as f(x,f(y,z))=f(y,f(x,z)), the count can be smaller).

It suffices for (a/b, c/d) to range through the consecutive pairs of Farey fractions of order n.
This is the same sequence (apart from the initial term) as A071111. The identity of these two sequences was first proved by Rustem Aidagulov and a detailed version of the proof can be found in the Alekseyev link below.
For sets of real numbers S and T, let S be a divider of T if some element of S lies strictly between any two distinct elements of T. Let Fence(n) = {a/n : a in Z}, Recip(n) = {1/b : 1 <= b <= n} Farey(n) = {a/b : a in Z, 1 <= b <= n}. Then a(n) is the smallest k such that Fence(k) is a divider of Recip(n) and also the smallest k such that Fence(k) is a divider of Farey(n), as shown by S. Rustem Aidagulov. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 30 2007
Suppose that S is a set of 2 or more real numbers.  The least m such that for every r and s in S there is an integer k such that r < k/m < s is the first separator of S.  The least m such that for every r and s in S there exists an integer k such that r < k/m < (k+1)/m < s is the second separator of S, and so on.

For example, A001000 gives first separators for the sets S(n) = {0,1/2,1/3,...,1/n}.  In the following guide, the set S(n) consists of numbers given by the shown formula for h = 1, 2, ..., n; F = A000045 (Fibonacci numbers), and r = (1+sqrt(5))/2 (golden ratio).

PROPERTIES: 
If you are looking for the Schroeder numbers (a.k.a. large Schroder numbers, or big Schroeder numbers), see A006318.
There are two schools of thought about the index for the first term. I prefer the indexing a(0) = a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3, a(3) = 11, etc.
a(n) = number of ways to insert parentheses in a string of n+1 symbols. The parentheses must be balanced but there is no restriction on the number of pairs of parentheses. The number of letters inside a pair of parentheses must be at least 2. Parentheses enclosing the whole string are ignored.
Also length of list produced by a variant of the Catalan producing iteration: replace each integer k with the list 0,1,..,k,k+1,k,...,1,0 and get the length a(n) of the resulting (flattened) list after n iterations. - _Wouter Meeussen_, Nov 11 2001
Stanley gives several other interpretations for these numbers.
Number of Schroeder paths of semilength n (i.e., lattice paths from (0,0) to (2n,0), with steps H=(2,0), U=(1,1) and D(1,-1) and not going below the x-axis) with no peaks at level 1. Example: a(2)=3 because among the six Schroeder paths of semilength two HH, UHD, UUDD, HUD, UDH and UDUD, only the first three have no peaks at level 1. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 27 2003
a(n+1) = number of Dyck n-paths in which the interior vertices of the ascents are colored white or black. - _David Callan_, Mar 14 2004
Number of possible schedules for n time slots in the first-come first-served (FCFS) printer policy.
Also row sums of A086810, A033282, A126216. - _Philippe Deléham_, May 09 2004
a(n+1) = number of pairs (u,v) of same-length compositions of n, 0's allowed in u but not in v and u dominates v (meaning u_1 >= v_1, u_1 + u_2 >= v_1 + v_2 and so on). For example, with n=2, a(3) counts (2,2), (1+1,1+1), (2+0,1+1). - _David Callan_, Jul 20 2005
The big Schroeder number (A006318) is the number of Schroeder paths from (0,0) to (n,n) (subdiagonal paths with steps (1,0) (0,1) and (1,1)). These paths fall in two classes: those with steps on the main diagonal and those without. These two classes are equinumerous and the number of paths in either class is the little Schroeder number a(n) (half the big Schroeder number). - Marcelo Aguiar (maguiar(AT)math.tamu.edu), Oct 14 2005
With offset 0, a(n) = number of (colored) Motzkin (n-1)-paths with each upstep U getting one of 2 colors and each flatstep F getting one of 3 colors. Example. With their colors immediately following upsteps/flatsteps, a(2) = 3 counts F1, F2, F3 and a(3)=11 counts U1D, U2D, F1F1, F1F2, F1F3, F2F1, F2F2, F2F3, F3F1, F3F2, F3F3. - _David Callan_, Aug 16 2006

Shifts left when INVERT transform applied twice. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Apr 01 2009
a(n) = A144944(n,n) = A186826(n,0). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 11 2013
Number of increasing tableaux of shape (n,n). An increasing tableau is a semistandard tableaux with strictly increasing rows and columns, and set of entries an initial segment of the positive integers. Example: a(2) = 3 because of the three tableaux (12)(34), (13)(24), (12)(23). - _Oliver Pechenik_, Apr 22 2014
Number of ordered trees with no vertex of outdegree 1 and having n+1 leaves (called sometimes Schröder trees). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 13 2014
Number of dissections of a convex (n+2)-gon by nonintersecting diagonals. Example: a(2)=3 because for a square ABCD we have (i) no diagonal, (ii) dissection with diagonal AC, and (iii) dissection with diagonal BD. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 13 2014
The little Schroeder numbers are the moments of the Marchenko-Pastur law for the case c=2 (although the moment m0 is 1/2 instead of 1): 1/2, 1, 3, 11, 45, 197, 903, ...  - _Jose-Javier Martinez_, Apr 07 2015
Number of generalized Motzkin paths with no level steps at height 0, from (0,0) to (2n,0), and consisting of steps U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H2=(2,0). For example, for n=3, we have the 11 paths: UDUDUD, UUDDUD, UDUUDD, UH2DUD, UDUH2D, UH2H2D, UUDUDD, UUUDDD, UUH2DD, UUDH2D, UH2UDD. - _José Luis Ramírez Ramírez_, Apr 20 2015
REVERT transform of A225883. - _Vladimir Reshetnikov_, Oct 25 2015
Total number of (nonempty) faces of all dimensions in the associahedron K_{n+1} of dimension n-1. For example, K_4 (a pentagon) includes 5 vertices and 5 edges together with K_4 itself (5 + 5 + 1 = 11), while K_5 includes 14 vertices, 21 edges and 9 faces together with K_5 itself (14 + 21 + 9 + 1 = 45). - _Noam Zeilberger_, Sep 17 2018

To be still more precise than Murthy and von Eitzen: the subsequence of the largest n-th power with n digits is a finite sequence, bounded by 9 and 109418989131512359209. It is guaranteed that 10^n has n + 1 digits in base 10, and clearly 9^n < 10^n. With a(22), the number n - log_10 a(n) crosses the 1.0 threshold, and obviously the gulf widens further after that, meaning that for n > 21, m^n can have fewer than n digits or more than n digits but not exactly n digits. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 12 2012

It was shown by Watson (and again by Ljunggren) that if 0^2 + 1^2 + ... + r^2 is a square then r = 0, 1 or 24.
The terms up to 1391 are == 0, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, 23 mod 24. Start number is in A007475(n). Square root of sum is in A076215(n). - _Ralf Stephan_, Nov 04 2002
The solutions in the case n=2 are in A001652 or A082291.
For k>5 and k = 1 or 5 (mod 6), it appears that all k^2 are here. When n is not a square, the solution to problem 6552 shows that there are an infinite number of sums of n consecutive squares that equal a square. There are only a finite number when n is a square. For example, the only sum having 49 terms is 25^2+...+73^2 = 357^2. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 20 2011
In the previous comment, "it appears" can be removed because the k^2 squares beginning at (k^2+1)(k^2-25)/48 sum to a square. - _Thomas Andrews_, Feb 14 2011
See A180442 for the complementary problem of finding numbers n such that there are consecutive squares beginning with n^2 that sum to a square.
From _Thomas Andrews_, Feb 22 2011: (Start)
Elementary necessary conditions for n to be in this sequence:
  1. If n=s^2b where b is squarefree, then:
     a. If s is divisible by 3 then b is divisible by 3.
     b. If s is divisible by 2, then b is divisible by 2.
     c. If b is divisible by 3, then b = 6 (mod 9)
     d. b only has prime factors p where 3 is a square, modulo p.  (So, p=2, p=3, or p=12k+/-1)
  2.
     a. If n+1 is divisible by 3, then (n+1)/3 is the sum of two perfect squares.
     b. If n+1 is not divisible by 3, then n+1 is the sum of two perfect squares
The smallest number which satisfies these conditions which is not in this sequence is 842.
These conditions can be used to establish the conjecture of Ralf Stephan, above, that all the terms are == 0, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, or 23 (mod 24.) (End)

a(p^k) == 1 mod p and a(n + p) == a(n + 1) mod p for all primes p.
a(0+19) == a(0+1) mod 19 or a(19^1) == 1 mod 19, that is, a(19) mod 19 = 1.
a(2+17) == a(2+1) mod 17. So a(19) == 19 mod 17, that is, a(19) mod 17 = 2.
a(6+13) == a(6+1) mod 13. So a(19) == 6129859 mod 13, that is, a(19) mod 13 = 8.
a(8+11) == a(8+1) mod 11. So a(19) == 44511042511 mod 11, that is, a(19) mod 11 = 1.
a(12+7) == a(12+1) mod 7. So a(19) == 171850728381587059351 mod 7, that is, a(19) mod 7 = 1.
a(14+5) == a(14+1) mod 5. So a(19) == 77567171020440688353049939 mod 5, that is, a(19) mod 5 = 4.
a(16+3) == a(16+1) mod 3. So a(19) == 122152541250295322862941281269151 mod 3, that is, a(19) mod 3 = 1.
a(17+2) == a(17+1) mod 2. So a(19) mod 2 = 1.
In conclusion, a(19) is a number of the form 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*n - 1615151, that is, 9699690*n - 1615151.

"Number of binary Lyndon words" means: number of binary strings inequivalent modulo rotation (cyclic permutation) of the digits and not having a period smaller than n. This provides a link to A103314, since these strings correspond to the inequivalent zero-sum subsets of U_m (m-th roots of unity) obtained by taking the union of U_n (n|m) with 0 or more U_d (n | d, d | m) multiplied by some power of exp(i 2Pi/n) to make them mutually disjoint. (But not all zero-sum subsets of U_m are of that form.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 14 2007

For n > 0, a(n) is also the number of orbits of size n of the transform associated to the Kolakoski sequence A000002 (and this is true for any map with 2^n periodic points of period n). The Kolakoski transform changes a sequence of 1's and 2's by the sequence of the lengths of its runs. The Kolakoski sequence is one of the two fixed points of this transform, the other being the same sequence without the initial term. A025142 and A025143 are the periodic points of the orbit of size 2. A027375(n) = n*a(n) gives the number of periodic points of minimal period n.
For n > 1, this sequence is equal to A059966 and to A060477, and for n = 1, a(1) = A059966(1)+1 = A060477(1)-1; this because the n-th term of all 3 sequences is equal to (1/n)*sum_{d|n} mu(n/d)*(2^d+e), with e = -1/0/1 for resp. A059966/this sequence/A060477, and sum_{d|n} mu(n/d) equals 1 for n = 1 and 0 for all n > 1. (End)
Warning: A000031 and A001037 are easily confused, since they have similar formulas.

Every amphichiral rational knot written in Conway notation is a palindromic sequence of numbers, not beginning or ending with 1. For example, for 4 <= n <= 12, the amphichiral rational knots are: 2 2, 2 1 1 2, 4 4, 3 1 1 3, 2 2 2 2, 4 1 1 4, 3 1 1 1 1 3, 2 3 3 2, 2 1 2 2 1 2, 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2, 6 6, 5 1 1 5, 4 2 2 4, 3 3 3 3, 2 4 4 2, 3 2 1 1 2 3, 3 1 2 2 1 3, 2 2 2 2 2 2, 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2, 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2, 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2.

Correspondence: a(n) = b(n)*2^(n-1), where b(n) is the sequence of the arithmetic means of previous two terms defined by b(n) = 1/2*(b(n-1) + b(n-2)) with initial values b(0) = 0, b(1) = 1; the g.f. for b(n) is B(x) := x/(1-(x^1+x^2)/2), so the g.f. A(x) for a(n) satisfies A(x) = B(2*x)/2. Because b(n) converges to the limit lim (1-x)*B(x) = 1/3*(b(0) + 2*b(1)) = 2/3 (for x --> 1), it follows that a(n)/2^(n-1) also converges to 2/3 (see also A103770). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Feb 04 2006

Example: (a, b, c) = (11, 11, 10) = (A005578(5), a(5), A000975(4). Then ((S-c), (S-b), (S-a)) = (6, 5, 5) = (A005578(4), a(4), A000975(3)). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 24 2007

The sequence emerges in using iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies to establish the best-response solution to the Cournot duopoly problem as a strictly dominant strategy. The best response of firm 1 to firm 2's chosen quantity is given by q*_1 = 1/2(a - c - q_2), where a is reservation price, c is marginal cost, and q_2 is firm two's chosen quantity. Given that q_2 is in [o, a - c], q*_1 must be in [o, 1/2(a - c)]. Since costs are symmetric, we know q_2 is in [0, 1/2(a - c)]. Then we know q*_1 is in [1/4(a - c), 1/2(a - c)]. Continuing in this way, the sequence of bounds we get (factoring out a - c) is {1/2, 1/4, 3/8, 5/16, ...}; the numerators are the Jacobsthal numbers. - _Michael Chirico_, Sep 10 2011

This sequence is connected with the Collatz problem. We consider the array T(i, j) where the i-th row gives the parity trajectory of i, for example for i = 6, the infinite trajectory is 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1... and T(6, j) = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, 1, ...]. Now, we consider the sum of the digits "1" of each column. We obtain the sequence a(n) = Sum_{k = 1..2^n} T(k, n) = Sum _{k = 1..2^n} digits "1" of the n-th column. Because a(n) + a(n+1) = 2^n, then a(n+1) = Number of digits "0" among the 2^n elements of the n-th column. - _Michel Lagneau_, Jan 11 2012
3!*a(n-1) is apparently the trace of the n-th power of the adjacency matrix of the complete 3-graph, a 3 X 3 matrix with diagonal elements all zero and off-diagonal all ones. The off-diagonal elements for the n-th power are all equal to a(n) while each diagonal element seems to be a(n) + 1 for an even power and a(n) - 1 for an odd. These are related to the lengths of closed paths on the graph (see Delfino and Viti's paper). - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 06 2012

By a factorization of n we mean a multiset of integers > 1 whose product is n.
For example, 6 is the product of 2 such multisets, {2, 3} and {6}, so a(6) = 2.
Similarly 8 is the product of 3 such multisets, {2, 2, 2}, {2, 4} and {8}, so a(8) = 3.
1 is the product of 1 such multiset, namely the empty multiset {}, whose product is by definition the multiplicative identity 1. Hence a(1) = 1. (End)

Cantor ordering of the integers producing a 1-1 and onto correspondence between the natural numbers and the integers showing that the set Z of integers has the same cardinality as the set N of natural numbers. The cardinal of N is the first transfinite cardinal aleph_null (or aleph_naught), which is the cardinality of a given infinite set if and only it is countably infinite (denumerable), i.e., it can be put in 1-1 and onto correspondence (with a proper Cantor ordering) with the natural numbers. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jan 23 2010
a(n) is the determinant of the (n+2) X (n+2) (0,1)-Toeplitz matrix M satisfying: M(i,j)=0 iff i=j or i=j-1. The matrix M arises in the variation of ménage problem where not a round table, but one side of a rectangular table is  considered (see comments of _Vladimir Shevelev_ in A000271). Namely M(i,j) defines the class of permutations p of 1,2,...,n+2 such that p(i)<>i and p(i)<>i+1 for i=1,2,...,n+1, and p(n+2)<>n+2. And a(n) is also the difference between the number of even and odd such permutations. - _Dmitry Efimov_, Mar 02 2017

Also, for n>0, the 4th term (after [0,n,3n]) in the continued fraction expansion of arctan(1/n). (Observation by V. Reshetnikov) Proof:
arctan(1/n) = (1/n) / (1 + (1/n)^2/( 3 + (2/n)^2/( 5 + (3/n)^2/( 7 + ...)...)
= 1 / ( n + 1/( 3n + 4/( 5n + 9/( 7n + 25/(...)...)
= 1 / ( n + 1/( 3n + 1/( 5n/4 + (9/4)/( 7n + 25/(...)...),
and the term added to 5n/4, (9/4)/(7n+...) = (1/4)*9/(7n+...) is less than 1/4 for all n>=2. (End)

In terms of A010096 the definition could read: "Number of iterations log_2(log_2(log_2(...(n)...))) such that the result is < 2".
With the only difference in the termination criterion, the definition is essentially the same as A010096. If we change the definition to " ...number < 1" we get A010096. Therefore we get A010096 when adding 1 to each term. (End)

For all elements x of the sequence, 12*x^2 - 12 is a square. Lim_{n -> inf} a(n)/a(n-1) = 2 + sqrt(3) = (4 + sqrt(12))/2 which preserves the kinship with the equation "12*x^2 - 12 is a square" where the initial "12" ends up appearing as a square root. - _Gregory V. Richardson_, Oct 10 2002

Even-indexed terms are odd while odd-indexed terms are even. Indeed, a(2*n) = 2*(a(n))^2 - 1 and a(2*n+1) = 2*a(n)*a(n+1) - 2. - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Oct 11 2016
For each n, a(0) divides a(n), a(1) divides a(2n+1), a(2) divides a(4*n+2), a(3) divides a(6*n+3), a(4) divides a(8*n+4), a(5) divides a(10n+5), and so on. Thus, a(k) divides a((2*n+1)*k) for each k > 0 and n >= 0. A proof of this can be found in Bhargava-Kedlaya-Ng's first solution to Problem A2 of the 76th Putnam Mathematical Competition. Links to the exam and its solutions can be found below. - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Oct 12 2016

If any term a(n) is a prime number, then its index n will be a power of 2. This is a consequence of the results given in the previous two comments. See A277434 for those prime terms.
a(2n) == 1 mod 6 and a(2*n+1) == 2 mod 6. Consequently, each odd prime factor of a(n) will be congruent to 1 modulo 6 and, thus, found in A002476.
a(n) == 1 mod 10 if n == 0 mod 6, a(n) == 2 mod 10 if n == {1,-1} mod 6, a(n) == 7 mod 10 if n == {2,-2} mod 6, and a(n) == 6 mod 10 if n == 3 mod 6. So, the rightmost digits of a(n) form a repeating cycle of length 6: 1, 2, 7, 6, 7, 2. (End)

a(2n)^2 = A001333(2n)^2 * (A001333(2n)^2 - 1)/2;
a(2n+1)^2 = A001333(2n+1)^2 * (A001333(2n+1)^2 + 1)/2;. -  _Richard R. Forberg_, Aug 30 2013
For n>=1, a(n) equals the number of 01-avoiding words of length n-1 on alphabet {0,1,...,5}. - _Milan Janjic_, Jan 25 2015
Panda and Rout call these "balancing numbers" and note that the period of the sequence modulo a prime p is the same as that modulo p^2 when p = 13, 31, 1546463. But these are precisely the p in A238736 such that p^2 divides A000129(p - (2/p)), where (2/p) is a Jacobi symbol. In light of the above observation by _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_ that the present sequence is one half the bisection of the Pell numbers, i.e., a(n) = A000129(2n)/2, it follows immediately that modulo a fixed prime p, or any power thereof, the period of a(n) is half that of A000129(n). - _John Blythe Dobson_, Mar 06 2015
The triangular number = square number identity Tri((T(n, 3) - 1)/2) = S(n-1, 6)^2 with Tri, T, and S given in A000217, A053120 and A049310, is the special case k = 1 of the k-family of identities Tri((T(n, 2*k+1) - 1)/2) = Tri(k)*S(n-1, 2*(2*k+1))^2, k >= 0, n >= 0, with S(-1, x) = 0. For k=2 see A108741(n) for S(n-1, 10)^2. This identity boils down to the identities S(n-1, 2*x)^2 = (T(2*n, x) - 1)/(2*(x^2-1)) and  2*T(n, x)^2 - 1 = T(2*n, x) with x = 2*k+1. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 01 2016
a(2)=6 is perfect. For n=2*k, k>0, k not equal to 1, a(n) is a multiple of a(2) and since every multiple (beyond 1) of a perfect number is abundant, then a(n) is abundant. sigma(a(4)) = 504 > 408 = 2*a(4). For n=2*k+1, k>0, a(n) mod 10 = A000012(n), so a(n) is odd. If a(n) is a prime number, it is deficient; otherwise a(n) has one or two distinct prime factors and is therefore deficient again. So for n=2k+1, k>0, a(n) is deficient. sigma(a(5)) = 1260 < 2378 = 2*a(5). - _Muniru A Asiru_, Apr 14 2016
Behera & Panda call these the balancing numbers, and A001541 are the balancers. - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 07 2017

Satisfies a recurrence of S_r type for r=36: 0, 1, 36 and a(n-1)*a(n+1)=(a(n)-1)^2. First observed by Colin Dickson in alt.math.recreational, Mar 07 2004. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Mar 14 2004
For every n, a(n) is the first of three triangular numbers in geometric progression. The third number in the progression is a(n+1). The middle triangular number is sqrt(a(n)*a(n+1)). Chen and Fang prove that four distinct triangular numbers are never in geometric progression. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 30 2007

The sequence is the case P1 = 36, P2 = 68, Q = 1 of the 3-parameter family of 4th order linear divisibility sequences found by Williams and Guy. - _Peter Bala_, Apr 03 2014
For n=2k, k>0, a(n) is divisible by 12 and is therefore abundant. I conjecture that for n=2k+1 a(n) is deficient [true for k up to 43 incl.]. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Sep 30 2014
The conjecture is true for all k>0 because: For n=2k+1, k>0, a(n) is odd. If a(n) is a prime number, it is deficient; otherwise a(n) has one or two distinct prime factors and is therefore deficient again. So for n=2k+1, k>0, a(n) is deficient. - _Muniru A Asiru_, Apr 13 2016

e maximizes the value of x^(c/x) for any real positive constant c, and minimizes for it for a negative constant, on the range x > 0. This explains why elements of A000792 are composed primarily of factors of 3, and where needed, some factors of 2. These are the two primes closest to e. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Oct 19 2014
There are two real solutions x to c^x = x^c when c, x > 0 and c != e, one of which is x = c, and only one real solution when c = e, where the solution is x = e. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Oct 22 2014

Artin conjectured that this sequence is infinite.
Conjecture: sequence contains infinitely many pairs of twin primes. - _Benoit Cloitre_, May 08 2003
Pieter Moree writes (Oct 20 2004): Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, it can be shown that the density of primes p such that a prescribed integer g has order (p-1)/t, with t fixed, exists and, moreover, it can be computed. This density will be a rational number times the so called Artin constant. For 2 and 10 the density of primitive roots is A, the Artin constant itself.
It seems that this sequence consists of A050229 \ {1,2}.
Primes p such that 1/p, when written in base 2, has period p-1, which is the greatest period possible for any integer.
Positive integer 2*m-1 is in the sequence iff A179382(m)=m-1. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jul 14 2010

Prime(n) is in the sequence if (and conjecturally only if) A133954(n) = prime(n). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Aug 30 2013
Pollack shows that, on the GRH, that there is some C such that a(n+1) - a(n) < C infinitely often (in fact, 1 can be replaced by any positive integer). Further, for any m, a(n), a(n+1), ..., a(n+m) are consecutive primes infinitely often. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 05 2015

Primes p such that 2 is a quadratic residue mod p.
Also primes p such that p divides 2^((p-1)/2) - 1. - _Cino Hilliard_, Sep 04 2004
A001132 is exactly formed by the prime numbers of A118905: in fact at first every prime p of A118905 is p = u^2 - v^2 + 2uv, with for example u odd and v even so that p - 1 = 4u'(u' + 1) + 4v'(2u' + 1 - v') when u = 2u' + 1 and v = 2v'. u'(u' + 1) is even and v'(2u' + 1 - v') is always even. At second hand if p = 8k +- 1, p has the shape x^2 - 2y^2; letting u = x - y and v = y, comes p = (x - y)^2 - y^2 + 2(x - y)y = u^2 - v^2 + 2uv so p is a sum of the two legs of a Pythagorean triangle. - _Richard Choulet_, Dec 16 2008

Or, number of distinct n-ary operators in a binary logic. The total number of n-ary operators in a k-valued logic is T = k^(k^n), i.e., if S is a set of k elements, there are T ways of mapping an ordered subset of n elements from S to an element of S. Some operators are "degenerate": the operator has arity p, if only p of the n input values influence the output. Therefore the set of operators can be partitioned into n+1 disjoint subsets representing arities from 0 to n.
For n = 2, k = 2 gives the familiar Boolean operators or functions, C = F(A,B). There are 2^2^2 = 16 operators, composed of: arity 0: 2 operators (C = 0 or 1), arity 1: 4 operators (C = A, B, not(A), not(B)), arity 2: 10 operators (including well-known pairs AND/NAND, OR/NOR, XOR/EQ). (End)

This is also the number of ways of arranging the elements of n distinct pairs, assuming the order of elements is significant but the pairs are not distinguishable, i.e., arrangements which are the same after permutations of the labels are equivalent.
If this sequence and A000680 are denoted by a(n) and b(n) respectively, then a(n) = b(n)/n! where n! = the number of ways of permuting the pair labels.
For example, there are 90 ways of arranging the elements of 3 pairs [1 1], [2 2], [3 3] when the pairs are distinguishable: A = { [112233], [112323], .... [332211] }.
By applying the 6 relabeling permutations to A, we can partition A into 90/6 = 15 subsets: B = { {[112233], [113322], [221133], [223311], [331122], [332211]}, {[112323], [113232], [221313], [223131], [331212], [332121]}, ....}
Each subset or equivalence class in B represents a unique pattern of pair relationships. For example, subset B1 above represents {3 disjoint pairs} and subset B2 represents {1 disjoint pair + 2 interleaved pairs}, with the order being significant (contrast A132101). (End)

a(n) is the number of subsets of {1,...,n^2} that contain exactly k elements from {1,...,k^2} for k=1,...,n. For example, a(3)=15 since there are 15 subsets of {1,2,...,9} that satisfy the conditions, namely, {1,2,5}, {1,2,6}, {1,2,7}, {1,2,8}, {1,2,9}, {1,3,5}, {1,3,6}, {1,3,7}, {1,3,8}, {1,3,9}, {1,4,5}, {1,4,6}, {1,4,7}, {1,4,8}, and {1,4,9}. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Dec 02 2011
a(n) is the leading coefficient of the Bessel polynomial y_n(x) (cf. A001498). - _Leonid Bedratyuk_, Jun 01 2012
For n>0: a(n) is also the determinant of the symmetric n X n matrix M defined by M(i,j) = min(i,j)^2 for 1 <= i,j <= n. - Enrique Pérez Herrero, Jan 14 2013
a(n) is also the numerator of the mean value from 0 to Pi/2 of sin(x)^(2n). - _Jean-François Alcover_, Jun 13 2013
a(n) is the size of the Brauer monoid on 2n points (see A227545). - _James Mitchell_, Jul 28 2013
For n>1: a(n) is the numerator of M(n)/M(1) where the numbers M(i) have the property that M(n+1)/M(n) ~ n-1/2 (for example, large Kendell-Mann numbers, see A000140 or A181609, as n --> infinity). - _Mikhail Gaichenkov_, Jan 14 2014
a(n) = the number of upper-triangular matrix representations required for the symbolic representation of a first order central moment of the multivariate normal distribution of dimension 2(n-1), i.e., E[X_1*X_2...*X_(2n-2)|mu=0, Sigma]. See vignette for symmoments R package on CRAN and Phillips reference below. - _Kem Phillips_, Aug 10 2014
For n>1: a(n) is the number of Feynman diagrams of order 2n (number of internal vertices) for the vacuum polarization with one charged loop only, in quantum electrodynamics. - _Robert Coquereaux_, Sep 15 2014
Aerated with intervening zeros (1,0,1,0,3,...) = a(n) (cf. A123023), the e.g.f. is e^(t^2/2), so this is the base for the Appell sequence A099174 with e.g.f. e^(t^2/2) e^(x*t) = exp(P(.,x),t) = unsigned A066325(x,t), the probabilist's (or normalized) Hermite polynomials. P(n,x)= (a. + x)^n with (a.)^n = a_n and comprise the umbral compositional inverses for A066325(x,t) = exp(UP(.,x),t), i.e., UP(n,P(.,t))= x^n = P(n,UP(.,t)), where UP(n,t) are the polynomials of A066325 and, e.g., (P(.,t))^n = P(n,t). - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 15 2014
a(n) = the number of relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one of size n. A relaxed compacted binary tree of size n is a directed acyclic graph consisting of a binary tree with n internal nodes, one leaf, and n pointers. It is constructed from a binary tree of size n, where the first leaf in a post-order traversal is kept and all other leaves are replaced by pointers. These links may point to any node that has already been visited by the post-order traversal. The right height is the maximal number of right-edges (or right children) on all paths from the root to any leaf after deleting all pointers. The numer of unbounded relaxed compacted binary trees of size n is A082161(n). See the Genitrini et al. link. - _Michael Wallner_, Jun 20 2017
Also the number of distinct adjacency matrices in the n-ladder rung graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jul 22 2017
From _Christopher J. Smyth_, Jan 26 2018: (Start)
a(n) = the number of essentially different ways of writing a probability distribution taking n+1 values as a sum of products of binary probability distributions. See comment of Mitch Harris above. This is because each such way corresponds to a full binary tree with n+1 leaves, with the leaves labeled by the values. (This comment is due to Niko Brummer.)
Also the number of binary trees with root labeled by an (n+1)-set S, its n+1 leaves by the singleton subsets of S, and other nodes labeled by subsets T of S so that the two daughter nodes of the node labeled by T are labeled by the two parts of a 2-partition of T. This also follows from Mitch Harris' comment above, since the leaf labels determine the labels of the other vertices of the tree.

N. Madras proved in 1999 the existence of lim_{n->oo} a(n+1)/a(n), which is the real limit growth rate of the number of polyominoes; and hence, this limit is equal to lim_{n->oo} a(n)^{1/n}, the well-known Klarner's constant. The currently best-known lower and upper bounds on this constant are 3.9801 (Barequet et al., 2006) and 4.6496 (Klarner and Rivest, 1973), respectively. But see also Knuth (2014).

PROPERTIES: 
Let X be a p X q rectangular matrix with random Gaussian entries. Expand E( tr (X'*X)^n ) as a polynomial in p and q for fixed n. Sequence gives coefficient of least significant term in polynomial.
There should be a reference to a paper by Guy et al. (?) that gives a formula.
An n-swap move consists of the removal of n edges and addition of n different edges which result in a new tour. A sequential n-swap is one in which the union of the n removed and n added edges forms a single cycle. The type can be characterized by how the n segments of the original tour formed by the removal are reassembled.

PROPERTIES: 
These numbers might also have been called Fibonacci periods.
Also, number of perfect multi-Skolem type sequences of order n.
Index the Fibonacci numbers so that 3 is the fourth number. If the modulo base is a Fibonacci number (>=3) with an even index, the period is twice the index. If the base is a Fibonacci number (>=5) with an odd index, the period is 4 times the index. - _Kerry Mitchell_, Dec 11 2005

PROPERTIES: 
If the Fibonacci numbers are indexed so that 3 is the fourth number, then if the modulo base is a Fibonacci number (>= 3) with an even index, the period has 2 zeros. If the base is a Fibonacci number (>= 5) with an odd index, the period has 4 zeros. - _Kerry Mitchell_, Dec 11 2005

NAME: Fibonacci entry points: a(n) = least k >= 1 such that n divides Fibonacci number F_k (=A000045(k)).

PROPERTIES: 
In the formula, the relation a(p^e) = p^(e-1)*a(p) is called Wall's conjecture, which has been verified for primes up to 10^14. See A060305. Primes for which this relation fails are called Wall-Sun-Sun primes. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 03 2009
All solutions to F_m == 0 (mod n) are given by m == 0 (mod a(n)). For a proof see, e.g., Vajda, p. 73. [Old comment changed by _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 19 2015]
If p is a prime of the form 10n +- 1 then a(p) is a divisor of p-1. If q is a prime of the form 10n +- 3 then a(q) is a divisor of q+1. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jul 07 2007
Definition 1 in Riasat (2011) calls this k(n), or sometimes just k. Corollary 1 in the same paper, "every positive integer divides infinitely many Fibonacci numbers," demonstrates that this sequence is infinite. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jul 27 2013
If p is a prime then a(p) <= p+1. This is because if p is a prime then exactly one of the following Fibonacci numbers is a multiple of p: F(p-1), F(p) or F(p+1). - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Jul 23 2015
From Renault 1996:
  1. a(gcd(n,m)) = gcd(a(n), a(m)).
  2. if n|m then a(n)|a(m).
  3. if m has prime factorization m=p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pn^en then a(m) = lcm(a(p1^e1), a(p2^e2), ..., a(pn^en)). - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Jul 23 2015
a(n)=n if and only if n=5^k or n=12*5^k for some k >= 0 (see Marques 2012). - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Aug 08 2015
Every positive integer (except 2) eventually appears in this sequence. This is because every Fibonacci number bigger than 1 (except Fibonacci(6)=8 and Fibonacci(12)=144) has at least one prime factor that is not a factor of any earlier Fibonacci number (see Knott reference). Let f(n) be such a prime factor for Fibonacci(n); then a(f(n))=n. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Aug 08 2015
We can reconstruct the Fibonacci numbers from this sequence using the formula Fibonacci(n+2) = 1 + Sum_{i: a(i) <= n} phi(i)*floor(n/a(i)), where phi(n) is Euler's totient function A000010 (see the Stroinski link). For example F(6) = 1 + phi(1)*floor(4/a(1)) + phi(2)*floor(4/a(2)) + phi(3)*floor(4/a(4)) = 1 + 1*4 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 8. - _Peter Bala_, Sep 10 2015
Conjecture: Sum_{d|n} phi(d)*a(d) = A232656(n). - _Logan J. Kleinwaks_, Oct 28 2017
a(F_m) = m for all m > 1. Indeed, let (b(j)) be defined by b(1)=b(2)=1, and b(j+2) = b(j) + b(j+1) mod n. Then a(n) equals the index of the first occurrence of 0 in (b(j)). Example: if n=4 then b = A079343 = 1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,..., so a(4)=6. If n is a Fibonacci number n=F_m, then obviously a(n)=m. Note that this gives a simple proof of the fact that all integers larger than 2 occur in (a(n)). - _Michel Dekking_, Nov 10 2017

See the Fulton and Morris link, where the function f is called pi and a(n)= omega(n) for n >= 2, and omega(24) should be 0.

The first 2^n terms of the sequence could be obtained using the Cantor-like process for the segment [0,4^n-1]. E.g., for n=1 we have [0,{1,2},3] such that numbers outside of braces are the first 2 terms of the sequence; for n=2 we have [0,{1,2},3,{4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11},12,{13,14},15] such that the numbers outside of braces are the first 4 terms of the sequence, etc. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Dec 17 2012

Also, the indices of the compositions having only even parts. For the definition of the index of a composition see A298644. For example, 195 is in the sequence since its binary form is 11000011 and the composition [2,4,2] has only even parts. 132 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 10000100 and the composition [1,4,1,2] has also odd parts.
The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n. (End)

Graves and Murty (2013) improved Silverman's result by showing that for any fixed k > 1, the abc-conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes == 1 (mod k) which are not in the sequence. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jan 21 2013

In a 1977 paper, Wells Johnson, citing a suggestion from Lawrence Washington, pointed out the repetitions in the binary representations of the numbers which are one less than the two known Wieferich primes; i.e., 1092 = 10001000100 (base 2); 3510 = 110110110110 (base 2). It is perhaps worth remarking that 1092 = 444 (base 16) and 3510 = 6666 (base 8), so that these numbers are small multiples of repunits in the respective bases. Whether this is mathematically significant does not appear to be known. - _John Blythe Dobson_, Sep 29 2007

It is believed that p^2 does not divide 3^(p-1) - 1 if p = a(n). This is true for n = 1 and 2. See A178815, A178844, A178900, and Ostafe-Shparlinski (2010) Section 1.1. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jun 29 2010

If q is prime and q^2 divides a prime-exponent Mersenne number, then q must be a Wieferich prime. Neither of the two known Wieferich primes divide Mersenne numbers. See Will Edgington's Mersenne page in the links below. - _Daran Gill_, Apr 04 2013

For some reason, both p=a(1) and p=a(2) also have more bases b with 1<b<p that make b^(p-1)==1 (mod p^2) than any smaller prime p; in other words a(1) and a(2) belong to A248865. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Jul 28 2015
Let r_1, r_2, r_3, ...., r_i be the set of roots of the polynomial X^((p-1)/2) - (p-3)! * X^((p-3)/2) - (p-5)! * X^((p-5)/2) - ... - 1. Then p is a Wieferich prime iff p divides sum{k=1, p}(r_k^((p-1)/2)) (see Example 2 in Jakubec, 1994). - _Felix Fröhlich_, May 27 2016
Arthur Wieferich showed that if p is not a term of this sequence, then the First Case of Fermat's Last Theorem has no solution in x, y and z for prime exponent p (cf. Wieferich, 1909). - _Felix Fröhlich_, May 27 2016
Let U_n(P, Q) be a Lucas sequence of the first kind, let e be the Legendre symbol (D/p) and let p be a prime not dividing 2QD, where D = P^2 - 4*Q. Then a prime p such that U_(p-e) == 0 (mod p^2) is called a "Lucas-Wieferich prime associated to the pair (P, Q)". Wieferich primes are those Lucas-Wieferich primes that are associated to the pair (3, 2) (cf. McIntosh, Roettger, 2007, p. 2088). - _Felix Fröhlich_, May 27 2016
Any repeated prime factor of a term of A000215 is a term of this sequence. Thus, if there exist infinitely many Fermat numbers that are not squarefree, then this sequence is infinite, since no two Fermat numbers share a common factor. - _Felix Fröhlich_, May 27 2016
If the Diophantine equation p^x - 2^y = d has more than one solution in positive integers (x, y), with (p, d) not being one of the pairs (3, 1), (3, -5), (3, -13) or (5, -3), then p is a term of this sequence (cf. Scott, Styer, 2004, Corollary to Theorem 2). - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jun 18 2016
Odd primes p such that Chi_(D_0)(p) != 1 and Lambda_p(Q(sqrt(D_0))) != 1, where D_0 < 0 is the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(1-p^2)) and Chi and Lambda are Iwasawa invariants (cf. Byeon, 2006, Proposition 1 (i)). - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jun 25 2016
If q is an odd prime, k, p are primes with p = 2*k+1, k == 3 (mod 4), p == -1 (mod q) and p =/= -1 (mod q^3) (Jakubec, 1998, Corollary 2 gives p == -5 (mod q) and p =/= -5 (mod q^3)) with the multiplicative order of q modulo k = (k-1)/2 and q dividing the class number of the real cyclotomic field Q(Zeta_p + (Zeta_p)^(-1)), then q is a term of this sequence (cf.

Conjecture: an integer n > 1 such that n^2 divides 2^(n-1)-1 must be a Wieferich prime. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Dec 21 2016
The above conjecture is equivalent to the statement that no "Wieferich pseudoprimes" (WPSPs) exist. While base-b WPSPs are known to exist for several bases b > 1 other than 2 (see for example A244752), no base-2 WPSPs are known. Since two necessary conditions for a composite to be a base-2 WPSP are that, both, it is a base-2 Fermat pseudoprime (A001567) and all its prime factors are Wieferich primes (cf. A270833), as shown in the comments in A240719, it seems that the first base-2 WPSP, if it exists, is probably very large. This appears to be supported by the guess that the properties of a composite to be a term of A001567 and of A270833 are "independent" of each other and by the observation that the scatterplot of A256517 seems to become "less dense" at the x-axis parallel line y = 2 for increasing n. It has been suggested in the literature that there could be asymptotically about log(log(x)) Wieferich primes below some number x, which is a function that grows to infinity, but does so very slowly. Considering the above constraints, the number of WPSPs may grow even more slowly, suggesting any such number, should it exist, probably lies far beyond any bound a brute-force search could reach in the forseeable future. Therefore I guess that the conjecture may be false, but a disproof or the discovery of a counterexample are probably extraordinarily difficult problems. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jan 18 2019

This is also the number of maximal ideals of the ring (Z/nZ,+,*). Since every finite integral domain must be a field, every prime ideal of Z/nZ is a maximal ideal and since in general each maximal ideal is prime, there are just as many prime ideals as maximal ones in Z/nZ, so the sequence gives the number of prime ideals of Z/nZ as well.
The reason why this number is given by the sequence is that the ideals of Z/nZ are precisely the subgroups of (Z/nZ,+). Hence for an ideal to be maximal it has form a maximal subgroup of (Z/nZ,+) and this is equivalent to having prime index in (Z/nZ) and this is equivalent to being generated by a single prime divisor of n.
Finally, all the groups arising in this way have different orders, hence are different, so the number of maximal ideals equals the number of distinct primes dividing n. (End)

Since (6a, 6b) is an admissible pattern of gaps for any integers a, b > 0 (and also if other multiples of 6 are inserted in between), the above conjecture follows from the prime k-tuple conjecture which states that any admissible pattern occurs infinitely often (see, e.g., the Caldwell link). This also means that any subsequence a(n .. n+m) with n > 2 (as to exclude the untypical primes 2 and 3) should occur infinitely many times at other starting points n'. - _M. F.

Consider C. G. Bower's theory of transforms given in a weblink below. For each positive integer k and each input sequence (b(n): n>=1) with g.f. B(x) = Sum_{n>=1} b(n)*x^n, let (a_k(n): n>=1) = BIK[k](b(n): n>=1). (We thus change some of the notation in Bower's weblink.) Here, BIK[k] is the "reversible, indistinct, unlabeled" transform for k boxes.
If BIK[k](x) = Sum_{n>=1} a_k(n)*x^n is the g.f. of the output sequence, then it can be proved that BIK[k](x) = (B(x)^k + B(x^2)^{k/2})/2, when k is even, and = B(x)*BIK[k-1](x), when k is odd. (We assume BIK[0](x) = 1.)
If (a(n): n>=1) = BIK(b(n): n>=1) with g.f. BIK(x) = 1 + Sum_{n>=1} a(n)*x^n, then BIK(x) = 1 + Sum_{k>=1} BIK[k](x). (The addition of the extra 1 in the g.f. seems arbitrary.) We then get BIK(x) = 1 + (1/2)*(B(x)/(1 - B(x)) + (B(x) + B(x^2))/(1 - B(x^2))).
For this sequence, the input sequence satisfies b(1) = b(2) = 1 and b(n) = 0 for n >= 3. Hence, B(x) = x + x^2 and BIK(x) = (1+x)*(1-x-x^3)/((1-x-x^2)*(1-x^2-x^4)), which equals Bower's g.f. in the formula section below.

PROPERTIES: 
From Wikipedia: "1729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number after a famous anecdote of the British mathematician G. H. Hardy regarding a hospital visit to the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. In Hardy's words: 'I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."'"
A011541 gives another version of "taxicab numbers".
If n is in this sequence, then n*k^3 is also in this sequence for all k > 0. So this sequence is obviously infinite. - _Altug Alkan_, May 09 2016

From _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 22 2007: (Start)
The n-th row can be generated by the following operation using an ascending row of (n-1) triangular terms, (A) and a descending row, (B); e.g., row 6:
A: 1....3....6....10....15
B: 15...10....6.....3.....1
C: 1...15...50....50....15....1 = row 6.
Leftmost column of A,B -> first two terms of C; then followed by the operation B*C/A of current column = next term of row C, (e.g., 10*15/3 = 50). Continuing with the operation, we get row 6: (1, 15, 50, 50, 15, 1). (End)
The previous comment can be upgraded to: The ConvOffsStoT transform of the triangular series; and by rows, row 6 is the ConvOffs transform of (1, 3, 6, 10, 15). Refer to triangle A117401 as another example of the ConvOffsStoT transform, and OEIS under Maple Transforms. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 09 2012
From the Kostov-Shapiro paper: "In the present paper we find a new interpretation of Narayana polynomials N_n(x) which are the generating polynomials for the Narayana numbers N_{n,k} counting Dyck paths of length n and with exactly k peaks. Strangely enough Narayana polynomials also occur as limits as n->oo of the sequences of eigenpolynomials of the Schur-Szego composition map sending (n-1)-tuples of polynomials of the form (x+1)^{n-1}(x+a) to their Schur-Szego product, see below. As a corollary we obtain that every N_n(x) has all roots real and non-positive. Additionally, we present an explicit formula for the density and the distribution function of the asymptotic root-counting measure of the polynomial sequence {N_n(x)}." - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Apr 08 2008
For a connection to Lagrange inversion, see A134264. - _Tom Copeland_, Aug 15 2008
T(n,k) is also the number of order-decreasing and order-preserving mappings (of an n-element set) of height k (height of a mapping is the cardinal of its image set). - _Abdullahi Umar_, Aug 21 2008
Row n of this triangle is the h-vector of the simplicial complex dual to an associahedron of type A_n [Fomin & Reading, p.60]. See A033282 for the corresponding array of f-vectors for associahedra of type A_n. See A008459 and A145903 for the h-vectors for associahedra of type B and type D respectively. The Hilbert transform of this triangle (see A145905 for the definition of this transform) is A145904. - _Peter Bala_, Oct 27 2008
T(n,k) is also the number of noncrossing set partitions of [n] into k blocks. Given a partition P of the set {1,2,...,n}, a crossing in P are four integers [a, b, c, d] with 1 <= a < b < c < d <= n for which a, c are together in a block, and b, d are together in a different block. A noncrossing partition is a partition with no crossings. - _Peter Luschny_, Apr 29 2011
Diagonals of A089732 are rows of A001263.- _Tom Copeland_, May 14 2012
From _Peter Bala_, Aug 07 2013: (Start)
Let E(y) = sum {n >= 0} y^n/(n!*(n+1)!) = 1/sqrt(y)*BesselI(1,2*sqrt(y)). Then this triangle is the generalized Riordan array (E(y), y) with respect to the sequence n!*(n+1)! as defined in Wang and Wang.
Generating function E(y)*E(x*y) = 1 + (1 + x)*y/(1!*2!) + (1 + 3*x + x^2)*y^2/(2!*3!) + (1 + 6*x + 6*x^2 + x^3)*y^3/(3!*4!) + .... Cf. A105278 with a generating function exp(y)*E(x*y).
The n-th power of this array has a generating function E(y)^n*E(x*y). In particular, the matrix inverse A103364 has a generating function E(x*y)/E(y). (End)
A166360(n-k) = T(n,k) mod 2. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 10 2013
T(n,k) is the number of nonintersecting n arches above the x axis, starting and ending on vertices 1 to 2n, with k being the number of arches starting on an odd vertice and ending on a higher even vertice. Example: T(3,2)=3  [16,25,34] [14,23,56] [12,36,45]. - _Roger Ford_, Jun 14 2014
Fomin and Reading on p. 31 state that the rows of the Narayana matrix are the h-vectors of the associahedra as well as its dual. - _Tom Copeland_, Jun 27 2017
The row polynomials P(n, x) = Sum_{k=1..n} T(n, k)*x^(k-1), together with P(0, x) = 1, multiplied by (n+1) are the numerator polynomials of the o.g.f.s of the diagonal sequences of the triangle A103371:  G(n, x) = (n+1)*P(n, x)/(1 - x)^{2*n+1}, for n >= 0. This is proved with Lagrange's theorem applied to the Riordan triangle A135278 = (1/(1 - x)^2, x/(1 - x)). See an example below. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 31 2017

On the set of positive integers, the orbit of any number seems to end in the orbit of 1, of 5 or of 17. Writing n=1+q*2^p with q odd, it is easily seen that for p=0,1 and p>3, some iterations of the map lead to a strictly smaller number (for n>17). The cases p=2 and p=3 may give rise to bigger loops (depending on the form of q). See sequences A135727-A135729 for maxima of the orbits and corresponding record indices. - _M. F.

a(n) = number of edges in the Hasse diagram for the weak Bruhat order on the symmetric group S_n. For permutations p,q in S_n, q covers p in the weak Bruhat order if p,q differ by an adjacent transposition and q has one more inversion than p. Thus 23514 covers 23154 due to the transposition that interchanges the third and fourth entries. Cf. A002538 for the strong Bruhat order. - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2007
a(n) is also the number of excedances in all permutations of {1,2,...,n} (an excedance of a permutation p is a value j such p(j)>j). Proof: j is exceeded (n-1)! times by each of the numbers j+1, j+2, ..., n; now, Sum[(n-j)(n-1)!,j=1..n)=n!(n-1)/2. Example: a(3)=6 because the number of excedances of the permutations 123, 132, 312, 213, 231, 321 are 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, respectively. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 15 2008

"Conway's relation twixt the triangular and pentagonal numbers: Divide the triangular numbers by 3 (when you can exactly):
0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55 66 78 91 105 120 136 153 ...
0 - 1 2 .- .5 .7 .- 12 15 .- 22 26 .- .35 .40 .- ..51 ...
.....-.-.....+..+.....-..-.....+..+......-...-.......+....
"and you get the pentagonal numbers in pairs, one of positive rank and the other negative.
"Append signs according as the pair have the same (+) or opposite (-) parity.
"Then Euler's pentagonal number theorem is easy to remember:
"p(n-0) - p(n-1) - p(n-2) + p(n-5) + p(n-7) - p(n-12) - p(n-15) ++-- = 0^n
where p(n) is the partition function, the left side terminates before the argument becomes negative and 0^n = 1 if n = 0 and = 0 if n > 0.
"E.g. p(0) = 1, p(7) = p(7-1) + p(7-2) - p(7-5) - p(7-7) + 0^7 = 11 + 7 - 2 - 1 + 0 = 15."

Vertex number of a square spiral whose edges have length A026741. The two axes of the spiral forming an "X" are A000326 and A005449. The four semi-axes forming an "X" are A049452, A049453, A033570 and the numbers >= 2 of A033568. - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 08 2011
A general formula for the generalized k-gonal numbers is given by n*((k - 2)*n - k + 4)/2, n=0, +-1, +-2, ..., k >= 5. - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 15 2011
a(n) is the number of 3-tuples (w,x,y) having all terms in {0,...,n} and 2*w = 2*x + y. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jun 04 2012
Generalized k-gonal numbers are second k-gonal numbers and positive terms of k-gonal numbers interleaved, k >= 5. - _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 04 2012
a(n) is the sum of the largest parts of the partitions of n+1 into exactly 2 parts. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Jan 26 2013
Conway's relation mentioned by _R. K. Guy_ is a relation between triangular numbers and generalized pentagonal numbers, two sequences from different families, but as triangular numbers are also generalized hexagonal numbers in this case we have a relation between two sequences from the same family. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 01 2013
Start with the sequence of all 0's. Add n to each value of a(n) and the next n - 1 terms. The result is the generalized pentagonal numbers. - _Wesley Ivan Hurt_, Nov 03 2014

Enge, Hart and Johansson proved: "Every generalised pentagonal number c >= 5 is the sum of a smaller one and twice a smaller one, that is, there are generalised pentagonal numbers a, b < c such that c = 2a + b." (see link theorem 5). - _Peter Luschny_, Aug 26 2016
The Enge, et al. result for c >= 5 also holds for c >= 2 if 0 is included as a generalized pentagonal number. That is, 2 = 2*1 + 0. - _Michael Somos_, Jun 02 2018
Suggestion for title, where n actually matches the list and b-file: "Generalized pentagonal numbers: k(n)*(3*k(n) - 1)/2, where k(n) = A001057(n) = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...], n >= 0" - _Daniel Forgues_, Jun 09 2018 & Jun 12 2018
Generalized k-gonal numbers are the partial sums of the sequence formed by the multiples of (k - 4) and the odd numbers (A005408) interleaved, with k >= 5. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jul 25 2018
The last digits form a symmetric cycle of length 40 [0, 1, 2, 5, ..., 5, 2, 1, 0], i.e., a(n) == a(n + 40) (mod 10) and a(n) == a(40*k - n - 1) (mod 10), 40*k > n. - _Alejandro J. Becerra Jr._, Aug 14 2018

Contribution from _Charlie Marion_, Jan 07 2009: (Start)
In general, denominators, a(k,n) and numerators, b(k,n), of continued fraction convergents to sqrt((k+1)/k) may be found as follows:
let a(k,0) = 1, a(k,1) = 2k; for n>0, a(k,2n) = 2*a(k,2n-1) + a(k,2n-2) and a(k,2n+1) = (2k)*a(k,2n) + a(k,2n-1);
let b(k,0) = 1, b(k,1) = 2k+1; for n>0, b(k,2n) = 2*b(k,2n-1) + b(k,2n-2) and b(k,2n+1) = (2k)*b(k,2n) + b(k,2n-1).
For example, the convergents to sqrt(2/1) start 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29.
In general, if a(k,n) and b(k,n) are the denominators and numerators, respectively, of continued fraction convergents to sqrt((k+1)/k) as defined above, then
k*a(k,2n)^2 - a(k,2n-1)*a(k,2n+1) = k = k*a(k,2n-2)*a(k,2n) - a(k,2n-1)^2 and
b(k,2n-1)*b(k,2n+1) - k*b(k,2n)^2 = k+1 = b(k,2n-1)^2 - k*b(k,2n-2)*b(k,2n);
for example, if k=1 and n=3, then b(1,n)=a(n+1) and
1*a(1,6)^2 - a(1,5)*a(1,7) = 1*169^2 - 70*408 = 1;
1*a(1,4)*a(1,6) - a(1,5)^2 = 1*29*169 - 70^2 = 1;
b(1,5)*b(1,7) - 1*b(1,6)^2 = 99*577 - 1*239^2 = 2;
b(1,5)^2 - 1*b(1,4)*b(1,6) = 99^2 - 1*41*239 = 2.

a(n) is the top left entry of the n-th power of any of the following six 3 X 3 binary matrices: [1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1; 1, 0, 0] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 0, 1; 1, 1, 0] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 0, 1; 1, 0, 1] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 0, 0; 1, 1, 1]. - _R.

a(n) = A000129(n) + A000129(n-1), where A000129(n) is the nth Pell Number; e.g., a(6) = 99 = A000129(6) + A000129(5) = 70 + 29. Hence the sequence of fractions has the form 1 + A000129(n-1)/A000129(n), and the ratio A000129(n-1)/A000129(n)converges to sqrt2 - 1. - _Gregory L. Simay_, Nov 30 2018

"Also the number of hierarchies with unlabeled elements and labeled levels where the levels are permuted.

a(n) = number of partitions of [n+1] into lists of sets that are both non-nesting and non-crossing. Non-nesting means that no set is contained in the span (interval from min to max) of another. For example, a(1) counts 12, 1-2, 2-1 and a(2) counts 123, 1-23, 23-1, 3-12, 12-3, 1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 3-1-2, 3-2-1. - _David Callan_, Sep 20 2007

a(n) is a difference divisibility sequence, that is, the difference a(n) - a(m) is divisible by n - m for all n and m (provided n is not equal to m). See A000522 for further properties of difference divisibility sequences.
a(n) equals the sum of the lengths of the paths between a pair of distinct vertices of the complete graph K_(n + 2) on n + 2 vertices [Hassani]. For example, for the complete graph K_4 with vertex set {A,B,C,D} the 5 paths between A and B are AB of length 1, ACB and ADB, both of length 2 and ACDB and ADCB, both of length 3. The sum of the lengths is 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 11 = a(2).
The number of paths between 2 distinct vertices of K_n is equal to A000522(n - 2); the number of simple cycles through a vertex of K_n equals A038154(n - 1).
Recurrence relation: a(0) = 1, a(1) = 3, a(n) = (n+2)*a(n - 1) - (n - 1)*a(n - 2) for n >= 2. The sequence b(n) := n*n! = A001563(n) satisfies the same recurrence with the initial conditions b(0) = 0, b(1) = 1. This leads to the finite continued fraction expansion a(n)/b(n) = 3 - 1/(4 - 2/(5 - 3/(6 - ... - (n - 1)/(n + 2)))), n >= 1.
Lim n -> infinity a(n)/b(n) = e = 3 - 1/(4 - 2/(5 - 3/(6 - ... - n/((n + 3) - ...)))).
For n >= 1, a(n) = b(n)*(3 - sum {k = 2..n} 1/(k!*(k - 1)*k) (see the remark by Deutsch above) since the rhs satisfies the above recurrence with the same initial conditions. Hence e = 3 - Sum_{k>=2} 1/(k!*(k - 1)*k).
For sequences satisfying the more general recurrence a(n) = (n + 1 + r)*a(n - 1) - (n - 1)*a(n - 2), which yield series acceleration formulas for e/r! that involve the Poisson-Charlier polynomials c_r(-n; -1), refer to A000522 (r=0), A082030 (r=2), A095000 (r=3) and A095177 (r=4). (End)
Binomial transform of n! Offset 1. a(3) = 11. - Al Hakanson (hawkuu(AT)gmail.com), May 18 2009
Equals eigensequence of a triangle with (1, 2, 3, ...) as the right border and the rest 1's; equivalent to a(n) = [n terms of the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) followed by (n + 1)] dot [(n + 1) terms of the sequence (1, 1, 3, 11, 245, ...)]. Example: 261 = a(4) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 5) dot (1, 1, 3, 11, 49) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 11 + 245 = 261. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 24 2010
Number of nonnegative integers which use each digit at most once in base n+1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Oct 02 2011.
a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n+2} in which there is an increasing contiguous subsequence (ascending run) beginning with 1 and ending with n+2. The number of such permutations with exactly k, 0<=k<=n, elements between the 1 and (n+2) is given by A132159(n,k) whose row sums equal this sequence. See example below. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Feb 15 2013

From _Michel Lagneau_, Jul 08 2014: (Start)
a(n) is defined also by the recurrence a(1)=1; for n>1, a(n+1) = 2*a(n) + sqrt(3*a(n)^2 + 1) where a(n) is an integer for every n. This sequence is generalizable by the sequence b(n,m) of parameter m with the initial condition b(1,m) = 1, and for n > 1 b(n+1,m) = m*b(n,m) + sqrt((m^2 - 1)*b(n,m)^2 + 1) for m = 2, 3, 4, ... where b(n,m) is an integer for every n.
The first corresponding sequences are
   b(n,2)  = a(n) = A001353(n);
   b(n,3)  = A001109(n);
   b(n,4)  = A001090(n);

   b(n,8)  = A077412(n);
   b(n,9)  = A049660(n);
   b(n,10) = A075843(n);
   b(n,11) = A077421(n);
   ....................
We obtain a general sequence of polynomials {b(n,x)} = {1, 2*x, 4*x^2 - 1, 8*x^3 - 4*x, 16*x^4 - 12*x^2 + 1, 32*x^5 - 32*x^3 + 6*x, ... } with x = m where each b(n,x) is a Gegenbauer polynomial defined by the recurrence b(n,x)- 2*x*b(n-1,x) + b(n-2,x) = 0, the same relation as the Chebyshev recurrence, but with the initial conditions b(x,0) = 1 and b(x,1) = 2*x instead b(x,0) = 1 and b(x,1) = x for the Chebyshev's polynomials. (End)
If a(n) denotes the n-th term of the above sequence and we construct a triangle whose sides are a(n) - 1, a(n) + 1 and sqrt(3a(n)^2 + 1), then, for every n the measure of one of the angles of the triangle so constructed will always be 120 degrees.

a(n) are the only primes, p(j), such that (p(j+m) - p(j)) divides (p(j+m) + p(j)) for some m > 0, where p(j) = A000040(j). For all such cases m=1. It is easy to prove, for j > 1, the only common factor of (p(j+m) - p(j)) and (p(j+m) + p(j)) is 2, and there are no common factors if j = 1. Thus, p(j) and p(j+m) are twin primes.

PROPERTIES: 
MacMahon calls this the potency of n.
Downgrades the operators in a prime decomposition. E.g., 40 factors as 2^3 * 5 and sopfr(40) = 2 * 3 + 5 = 11.
Consider all ways of writing n as a product of zero, one, or more factors; sequence gives smallest sum of terms. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Jul 07 2001
a(n) <= n for all n, and a(n) = n iff n is 4 or a prime.
Look at the graph of this sequence. At the lower edge of the logarithmic scatterplot there is a set of fuzzy but unmistakable diagonal fringes, sloping toward the southeast. Their spacing gradually increases, and their slopes gradually decrease; they are more distinct toward the lower edge of the range. Is any explanation known? - _Allan C. Wechsler_, Oct 11 2015
For n >= 2, the glb and lub are: 3 * log(n) / log(3) <= a(n) <= n, where the lub occurs when n = 3^k, k >= 1. (Jakimczuk 2012) - _Daniel Forgues_, Oct 12 2015
Except for the initial term, row sums of A027746. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 08 2016
Atanassov proves that a(n) <= A065387(n) - n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 06 2016

This sequence occurs as the right-hand side of the binomial sum identity Sum_{k = 0..n} (-1)^(k)*binomial(n,k)*binomial(2*n + k,n)*binomial(3*n - k,n) = (-1)^m*a(m) for n = 2*m. The sum vanishes for n odd. Cf. A273628 and A273629.
Note the similar results:
Sum_{k = 0..n} (-1)^k*binomial(n,k)* binomial(2*n + k,n)*binomial(3*n + k,n) = (-1)^n*(3*n)!/n!^3 = (-1)^n*A006480(n);
Sum_{k = 0..n} (-1)^k*binomial(n,k)*binomial(2*n - k,n)*binomial(3*n - k,n) = binomial(2*n,n)^2 = A002894(n);
Sum_{k = 0..2*n} (-1)^k*binomial(2*n,k)*binomial(2*n + k,n)*binomial(3*n + k,n) = Sum_{k = 0..2*n} (-1)^k*binomial(2*n,k)*binomial(2*n - k,n)*binomial(3*n - k,n) = binomial(2*n,n) = A000984(n);
Sum_{k = 0..2*n} (-1)^k*binomial(2*n,k)*binomial(2*n + k,n)*binomial(3*n - k,n) = Sum_{k = 0..2*n} (-1)^k*binomial(2*n,k)*binomial(2*n - k,n)*binomial(3*n + k,n) = (-1)^n*binomial(2*n,n) = (-1)^n*A000984(n). (End)
Choose three noncollinear step vectors to satisfy the zero sum, 3*v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = 0. Then a(n) is the number of loop plane walks of length 5*n which depart from and return to the origin. Equivalently, a(n) counts distinct permutations of a (5*n)-digit integer with digits 1,2,3 of multiplicity 3*n,n,n respectively. - _Bradley Klee_, Aug 12 2018

Vardi gives several identities satisfied by A001463 and this sequence.
We can interpret A001462 as a triangle: start with 1; 2,2; 3,3; and proceed by letting the row sum of row m-1 be the number of elements of row m. The partial sums of the row sums give 1, 5, 11, 38, 272, ... Conjecture: this proceeds as Lionel Levile's sequence A014644. See also A113676. - _Floor van Lamoen_, Nov 06 2005

A Golomb-type sequence, that is, one with the property of being a sequence of run length of itself, can be built over any sequence with distinct terms by repeating each term a corresponding number of times, in the same manner as a(n) is built over natural numbers. See cross-references for more examples. - _Ivan Neretin_, Mar 29 2015

Numbers that are the norms of Gaussian integers. This sequence has unique factorization; the primitive elements are A055025. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 25 2011
These are numbers n such that all of n's odd prime factors congruent to 3 modulo 4 occur to an even exponent (Fermat's two-squares theorem). - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, May 01 2013
Let's say that an integer n divides a lattice if there exists a sublattice of index n. Example: 2, 4, 5 divide the square lattice. The present sequence without 0 is the sequence of divisors of the square lattice. Say that n is a "prime divisor" if the index-n sublattice is not contained in any other sublattice except the original lattice itself. Then A055025 (norms of Gaussian primes) gives the "prime divisors" of the square lattice. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, May 01 2013
For any i,j > 0 a(i)*a(j) is a member of this sequence, since (a^2 + b^2)*(c^2 + d^2) = (a*c + b*d)^2 + (a*d - b*c)^2. - _Boris Putievskiy_, May 05 2013
The sequence is closed under multiplication. Primitive elements are in A055025. The sequence can be split into 3 multiplicatively closed subsequences: {0}, A004431 and A125853. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Nov 17 2013
Generalizing Jasinski's comment, same as numbers whose odd powers are the sum of 2 squares, by Fermat's two-squares theorem. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jan 24 2014
By the 4 squares theorem, every nonnegative integer can be expressed as the sum of two elements of this sequence. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Mar 28 2015
There are never more than 3 consecutive terms. Runs of 3 terms start at 0, 8, 16, 72, ... (A082982). - _Ivan Neretin_, Nov 09 2015
Any composite term of this sequence has at least one prime factor that is also in this sequence. This follows from Wilson's comment of 2004 and Adams-Watters's comment of 2011. - _Alonso del Arte_, Aug 12 2016

SEQUENCE: 1,1,1,1,3,3,1,6,15,15,1,10,45,105,105,1,15,105,420,945,945,1,21,210,1260,4725,10395,10395,1,28,378,3150,17325,62370,135135,135135,1,36,630,6930,51975,270270,945945,2027025,2027025,1,45,990,13860,135135,945945,4729725,16216200,34459425,34459425
PROPERTIES: 
The row polynomials with exponents in increasing order (e.g., third row: 1+3x+3x^2) are Grosswald's y_{n}(x) polynomials, p. 18, Eq. (7).
Also called Bessel numbers of first kind.
The triangle a(n,k) has factorization [C(n,k)][C(k,n-k)]Diag((2n-1)!!) The triangle a(n-k,k) is A100861, which gives coefficients of scaled Hermite polynomials. - _Paul Barry_, May 21 2005
Related to k-matchings of the complete graph K_n by a(n,k)=A100861(n+k,k). Related to the Morgan-Voyce polynomials by a(n,k)=(2k-1)!!*A085478(n,k). - _Paul Barry_, Aug 17 2005
Related to Hermite polynomials by a(n,k)=(-1)^k*A060821(n+k, n-k)/2^n. - _Paul Barry_, Aug 28 2005
The row polynomials, the Bessel polynomials y(n,x):=Sum_{m=0..n} (a(n,m)*x^m) (called y_{n}(x) in the Grosswald reference) satisfy (x^2)*(d^2/dx^2)y(n,x) + 2*(x+1)*(d/dx)y(n,x) - n*(n+1)*y(n,x)) = 0.
a(n-1, m-1), n >= m >= 1, enumerates unordered n-vertex forests composed of m plane (aka ordered) increasing (rooted) trees. Proof from the e.g.f. of the first column Y(z):=1-sqrt(1-2*z) (offset 1) and the Bergeron et al. eq. (8) Y'(z)= phi(Y(z)), Y(0)=0, with out-degree o.g.f. phi(w)=1/(1-w). See their remark on p. 28 on plane recursive trees. For m=1 see the D. Callan comment on A001147 from Oct 26 2006. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 14 2007
The asymptotic expansions of the higher order exponential integrals E(x,m,n), see A163931 for information, lead to the Bessel numbers of the first kind in an intriguing way. For the first four values of m these asymptotic expansions lead to the triangles A130534 (m=1), A028421 (m=2), A163932 (m=3) and A163934 (m=4). The o.g.f.s. of the right hand columns of these triangles in their turn lead to the triangles A163936 (m=1), A163937 (m=2), A163938 (m=3) and A163939 (m=4). The row sums of these four triangles lead to A001147, A001147 (minus a(0)), A001879 and A000457 which are the first four right hand columns of A001498. We checked this phenomenon for a few more values of m and found that this pattern persists: m = 5 leads to A001880, m=6 to A001881, m=7 to A038121 and m=8 to A130563 which are the next four right hand columns of A001498. So one by one all columns of the triangle of coefficients of Bessel polynomials appear. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Oct 07 2009
a(n,k) also appear as coefficients of (n+1)st degree of the differential operator D:=1/t d/dt, namely D^{n+1}= Sum_{k=0..n} a(n,k) (-1)^{n-k} t^{1-(n+k)} (d^{n+1-k}/dt^{n+1-k}. - _Leonid Bedratyuk_, Aug 06 2010

a(n) is also the frequency of the largest part in the integer partition having viabin number n. The viabin number of an integer partition is defined in the following way. Consider the southeast border of the Ferrers board of the integer partition and consider the binary number obtained by replacing each east step with 1 and each north step, except the last one, with 0. The corresponding decimal form is, by definition, the viabin number of the given integer partition. "Viabin" is coined from "via binary". For example, consider the integer partition [2,2,2,1]. The southeast border of its Ferrers board yields 10100, leading to the viabin number 20. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 24 2017

Graham and Pollak give an elementary proof of the following result: For given m, define a_n by a_1 = m and a_{n+1} = [ sqrt{2*a_n*(a_n + 1)} ], n >= 1.

If all the permutations of any length k are arranged in lexicographic order, the n-th term in this sequence (n <= k) gives the index of the permutation that rotates the last n elements one position to the right. E.g., there are 24 permutations of 4 items. In lexicographic order they are (0,1,2,3), (0,1,3,2), (0,2,1,3), ... (3,2,0,1), (3,2,1,0). Permutation 0 is (0,1,2,3), which rotates the last 1 element, i.e., it makes no change. Permutation 1 is (0,1,3,2), which rotates the last 2 elements. Permutation 4 is (0,3,1,2), which rotates the last 3 elements. Permutation 18 is (3,0,1,2), which rotates the last 4 elements. The same numbers work for permutations of any length. - Henry H.

a(n) is also the number of isolated fixed points (i.e. adjacent fixed points are not isolated) in all permutations of [n+2]. Example: a(2)=14 because we have (the isolated fixed points are marked) 1'423, 1'324', 1'342, 1'43'2, 413'2, 3124', 42'13, 2314', 243'1, 32'14', 32'41. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Apr 18 2009
The average of the first n terms is n factorial. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 20 2010
Number of blocks in all permutations of [n+1]. A block of a permutation is a maximal sequence of consecutive integers which appear in consecutive positions. For example, the permutation 5412367 has 4 blocks: 5, 4, 123, and 67. Example: a(2)=14 because the permutations of [3], separated into blocks, are 123, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 23-1, 3-12, 3-2-1 with 1+3+3+2+2+3=14 blocks. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 12 2010

a(n) is the number of isolated entries in all permutations of [n+2]. An entry j of a permutation p is isolated if it is not preceded by j-1 and not followed by j+1. For example, the permutation 23178564 has 2 isolated entries: 1 and 4. a(1)=11 because in 123, 1'3'2', 2'1'3', 231', 3'12, and 3'2'1' we have a total of 11 isolated entries (they are marked).

The present sequence corresponds to the case x = 3 of the following general remarks.
The recurrence a(n+1) = a(n)^2 - 2 with initial condition a(0) = x > 2 has the solution a(n) = ((x + sqrt(x^2 - 4))/2)^(2^n) + ((x - sqrt(x^2 - 4))/2)^(2^n).
We have the product expansion sqrt(x + 2)/sqrt(x - 2) = product {n = 0..inf} (1 + 2/a(n)) (essentially due to Euler - see Mendes-France and van der Poorten). Another expansion is sqrt(x^2 - 4)/(x + 1) = product {n = 0..inf} (1 - 1/a(n)), which follows by iterating the identity sqrt(x^2 - 4)/(x + 1) = (1 - 1/x)*sqrt(y^2 - 4)/(y + 1), where y = x^2 - 2.
The sequence b(n) := a(n) - 1 satisfies b(n+1) = b(n)^2 + 2*b(n) - 2. Cases currently in the database are A145502 through A145510. The sequence c(n) := a(n)/2 satisfies c(n+1) = 2*c(n)^2 - 1. Cases currently in the database are A002812, A001601, A005828, A084764 and A084765.

Since gcd(F(n),F(k)) = F(gcd(n,k)), the non-primitive prime factors of F(n) are factors of F(k) for some proper divisors k of n.
Since prime p divides F(p-1) if p == 1 or 4 (mod 5), F(p+1) if p == 2 or 3 mod 5, F(p) if p = 5, we have a(n) >= n-1 if a(n) > 1.

The Springer numbers were originally considered by Glaisher (see references). They are a type B analog of the zigzag numbers A000111 for the group of signed permutations.
COMBINATORIAL INTERPRETATIONS
Several combinatorial interpretations of the Springer numbers are known:
1) a(n) gives the number of Weyl chambers in the principal Springer cone of the Coxeter group B_n of symmetries of an n dimensional cube. An example can be found in [Arnold - The Calculus of snakes...].
2) Arnold found an alternative combinatorial interpretation of the Springer numbers in terms of snakes. Snakes are a generalization of alternating permutations to the group of signed permutations. A signed permutation is a sequence (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) of integers such that {|x_1|,|x_2|,...,|x_n|} = {1,2,...,n}. They form a group, the hyperoctahedral group of order 2^n*n! = A000165(n), isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the n dimensional cube. A snake of type B_n is a signed permutation (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) such that 0 < x_1  > x_2 < ... x_n. For example, (3,-4,-2,-5,1,-6) is a snake of type B_6. a(n) gives the number of snakes of type B_n [Arnold]. The cases n=2 and n=3 are given in the Example section below.
3) The Springer numbers also arise in the study of the critical points of functions; they count the topological types of odd functions with 2*n critical values [Arnold, Theorem 35].
4) Let F_n be the set of plane rooted forests satisfying the following conditions:
... each root has exactly one child, and each of the other internal nodes has exactly two (ordered) children,
... there are n nodes labeled by integers from 1 to n, but some leaves can be non-labeled (these are called empty leaves), and labels are increasing from each root down to the leaves. Then a(n) equals the cardinality of F_n. An example and proof are given in [Verges, Theorem 4.5].
OTHER APPEARANCES OF THE SPRINGER NUMBERS
1) Hoffman has given a connection between Springer numbers, snakes and the successive derivatives of the secant and tangent functions.
2) For integer N the quarter Gauss sums Q(N) are defined by ... Q(N) := Sum_{r = 0..floor(N/4)} exp(2*Pi*I*r^2/N). In the cases N = 1 (mod 4) and N = 3 (mod 4) an asymptotic series for Q(N) as N -> inf that involves the Springer numbers has been given by Evans et al., see 1.32 and 1.33.
For a sequence of polynomials related to the Springer numbers see A185417. For a table to recursively compute the Springer numbers see A185418.
(End)
Similar to the way in which the signed Euler numbers A122045 are 2^n times the value of the Euler polynomials at 1/2, the generalized signed Euler numbers A188458 can be seen as 2^n times the value of generalized Euler polynomials at 1/2. These are the Swiss-Knife polynomials A153641. A recursive definition of these polynomials is given in A081658. - _Peter Luschny_, Jul 19 2012
a(n) is the number of reverse-complementary updown permutations of [2n]. For example, the updown permutation 241635 is reverse-complementary because its complement is 536142, which is the same as its reverse, and a(2)=3 counts 1324, 2413, 3412. - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2012
a(n) = |2^n G(n,1/2;-1)|, a specialization of the Appell sequence of polynomials umbrally formed by G(n,x;t) = (G(.,0;t) + x)^n from the Grassmann polynomials G(n,0;t) of A046802 enumerating the cells of the positive Grassmannians. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 14 2015

Note that the harmonic mean of the divisors of n = n*tau(n)/sigma(n).
Equivalently, n*tau(n)/sigma(n) is an integer, where tau(n) (A000005) is the number of divisors of n and sigma(n) is the sum of the divisors of n (A000203).
Equivalently, the average of the divisors of n divides n.
Note that the average of the divisors of n is not necessarily an integer, so the above wording should be clarified as follows: n divided by the average is an integer. See A007340. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Oct 26 2014
Ore showed that every perfect number (A000396) is harmonic. The converse does not hold: 140 is harmonic but not perfect. Ore conjectured that 1 is the only odd harmonic number.
Other examples of power mean numbers n such that some power mean of the divisors of n is an integer are the RMS numbers A140480. - _Ctibor O. Zizka_, Sep 20 2008

Let r1, r2 and r3 denote the roots of x^3 - x - 1. Then the following identity holds: a(k*n) + (a(k))^n - (a(k) - r1^k)^n - (a(k) - r2^k)^n - (a(k) - r3^k)^n
= 0 for n = 0, 1, 2,
= 6 for n = 3,
= 12*a(k) for n = 4,
= 10*[2*(a(k))^2 - a(-k)] for n = 5,
= 30*a(k)*[(a(k))^2 - a(-k)] for n = 6,
= 7*[6*(a(k))^4 - 9*a(-k)*(a(k))^2 + 2*(a(-k))^2 - a(k)] for n = 7,
= 56*a(k)*[((a(k))^2 - a(-k))^2 - a(k)/2] for n = 8,
where a(-k) = -A078712(k) and the formula (5.40) from the paper of Witula and Slota is used. (End)
The parity sequence of a(n) is periodic with period 7 and has the form (1,0,0,1,0,1,1). Hence we get that a(n) and a(2*n) are congruent modulo 2. Similarly we deduce that a(n) and a(3*n) are congruent modulo 3. Is it true that a(n) and a(p*n) are congruent modulo p for every prime p? - _Roman Witula_, Feb 09 2013
The trinomial x^3 - x - 1 divides the polynomial x^(3*n) - a(n)*x^(2*n) + ((a(n)^2 - a(2*n))/2)*x^n - 1 for every n>=1. For example, for n=3 we obtain the factorization x^9 - 3*x^6 + 2*x^3 - 1 = (x^3 - x - 1)*(x^6 + x^4 - 2*x^3 + x^2 - x + 1). Sketch of the proof: Let p,s,t be roots of the Perrin polynomial x^3 - x - 1. Then we have (a(n))^2 = (p^n + s^n + t^n)^2 = a(2*n) + 2*a(n)*x^n -2*x^n + 2/x^n for every x = p,s,t, i.e. x^(3*n) - a(n)*x^(2*n) + ((a(n)^2 - a(2*n))/2)*x^n - 1 = 0 for every x = p,s,t, which finishes the proof. By discussion of the power(a(n))^3 = (p^n + s^n + t^n)^3 it can be deduced that the trinomial x^3 - x - 1 divides the polynomial 2*x^(4*n) - a(n)*x^(3*n) - a(2*n)*x^(2*n) + ((a(n)^3 - a(3*n) - 3)/3)*x^n - a(n) = 0.

This comment covers a family of sequences which satisfy a recurrence of the form a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-m), with a(n) = 1 for n = 1...m-1, a(m) = m+1. The generating function is (x+m*x^m)/(1-x-x^m). Also a(n) = 1 + n*sum(binomial(n-1-(m-1)*i, i-1)/i, i=1..n/m).

From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 11 2017: (Start)
a(n) is the number of cyclic sequences consisting of zeros and ones that avoid the pattern 001 (or equivalently, the pattern 110) provided the positions of zeros and ones on a circle are fixed. This can easily be proved by considering that sequence A000071(n+3) is the number of binary zero-one words of length n that avoid the pattern 001 and that a(n) = A000071(n+3) - 2*A000071(n). (From the collection of all zero-one binary sequences that avoid 001 subtract those that start with 1 and end with 00 and those that start with 01 and end with 0.)
For n = 1,2, the number a(n) still gives the number of cyclic sequences consisting of zeros and ones that avoid the pattern 001 (provided the positions of zeros and ones on a circle are fixed) even if we assume that the sequence wraps around itself on the circle. For example, when 01 wraps around itself, it becomes 01010..., and it never contains the pattern 001. (End)
For n >= 3, a(n) is also the number of independent vertex sets and vertex covers in the wheel graph on n+1 nodes. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Mar 31 2017

PROPERTIES: 
Number of primitive sublattices of index n in generic 2-dimensional lattice; also index of Gamma_0(n) in SL_2(Z).
A generic 2-dimensional lattice L = <V,W> consists of all vectors of the form mV + nW, (m,n integers). A sublattice S = <aV+bW, cV+dW> has index |ad-bc| and is primitive if gcd(a,b,c,d) = 1. The generic lattice L has precisely a(2) = 3 sublattices of index 2, namely <2V,W>, <V,2W> and <V+W,2V> (which = <V+W,2W>) and so on for other indices.
The sublattices of index n are in 1-to-1 correspondence with matrices [a b; 0 d] with a>0, ad=n, b in [0..d-1]. The number of these is Sum_{d|n} = sigma(n), which is A000203. A sublattice is primitive if gcd(a,b,d) = 1; the number of these is n * product_{p|n} (1+1/p), which is the present sequence.
SL_2(Z) = Gamma is the group of all 2 X 2 matrices [a b; c d] where a,b,c,d are integers with ad-bc = 1 and Gamma_0(N) is usually defined as the subgroup of this for which N|c. But conceptually Gamma is best thought of as the group of (positive) automorphisms of a lattice <V,W>, its typical element taking V -> aV + bW, W -> cV + dW and then Gamma_0(N) can be defined as the subgroup consisting of the automorphisms that fix the sublattice <NV,W> of index N. - _J. H. Conway_, May 05 2001
Dedekind proved that if n = k_i*j_i for i in I represents all the ways to write n as a product, and e_i=gcd(k_i,j_i), then a(n)= sum(k_i / (e_i * phi(e_i)), i in I ) [cf. Dickson, History of the Theory of Numbers, Vol. 1, p. 123].

The golden ratio phi is the most irrational among irrational numbers; its successive continued fraction convergents F(n+1)/F(n) are the slowest to approximate to its actual value (I. Stewart, in 'Nature's Numbers', Basic Books 1997). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jan 21 2005
Let t=golden ratio.  The lesser sqrt(5)-contraction rectangle has shape t-1, and the greater sqrt(5)-contraction rectangle has shape t. For definitions of shape and contraction rectangles, see A188739. - _Clark Kimberling_, Apr 16 2011
The golden ratio (often denoted by phi or tau) is the shape (i.e., length/width) of the golden rectangle, which has the special property that removal of a square from one end leaves a rectangle of the same shape as the original rectangle. Analogously, removals of certain isosceles triangles characterize side-golden and angle-golden triangles. Repeated removals in these configurations result in infinite partitions of golden rectangles and triangles into squares or isosceles triangles so as to match the continued fraction, [1,1,1,1,1,...] of tau. For the special shape of rectangle which partitions into golden rectangles so as to match the continued fraction [tau, tau, tau, ...], see A188635. For other rectangular shapes which depend on tau, see A189970, A190177, A190179, A180182. For triangular shapes which depend on tau, see A152149 and A188594; for tetrahedral, see A178988. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 06 2011

For n >= 3, a(n) is the number of cyclic sequences consisting of n zeros and ones that do not contain three consecutive ones provided the positions of the zeros and ones are fixed on a circle. This is proved in Charalambides (1991) and Zhang and Hadjicostas (2015). For example, a(3)=7 because only the sequences 110, 101, 011, 001, 010, 100 and 000 avoid three consecutive ones.

This leads to primitive triples because gcd(u,v) = 1 is respected. This corresponds to (primitive) Pythagorean triangles with |x-y|=1 (the catheti differ by one length unit).

(a(n), a(n+1)), with a(0):= 1, give all proper positive solutions m1 = m1(n) and m2 = m2(n), with m1 < m2 and n >= 0, of the Markoff triple (m, m1, m2) (see A002559) for m = 2, i.e., m1^2 - 6*m1*m2 + m2^2 = -4. Hence the unique Markoff triple with largest value m = 2 is (1, 1, 2) (for general m from A002559 this is the famous uniqueness conjecture).
For X = m2 - m1 and Y = m2 this becomes the reduced indefinite quadratic form representation X^2 + 4*X*Y - 4*Y^2 = -4, with discriminant 32, and the only proper fundamental solution (X(0), Y(0)) = (0, 1). For all nonnegative proper (X(n), Y(n)) solutions see (A005319(n) = a(n+1) - a(n), a(n+1)), for n >= 0. (End)
Each Pell(2*k+1) = a(k+1) number with k >= 3 appears as largest number of an ordered Markoff (Markov) triple [x, y, m] with smallest value x = 2 as [2, Pell(2*k-1), Pell(2*k+1)]. This known result follows also from all positive proper solutions of the Pell equation q^2 - 2*m^2 = -1 which are q = q(k) = A002315(k)  and m = m(k) = Pell(2*k+1), for k >= 0. y = y(k) = m(k) - 2*q(k) = Pell(2*k-1), with Pell(-1) = 1. The k = 0 and 1 cases do not satisfy x=2 <= y(k) <= m(k). The numbers 1 and 5 appear also as largest Markoff triple members because they are also Fibonacci numbers, and for these triples x=1. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 11 2018

a(n) is also the sum of the positions of the right-to-left minima in all permutations of [n]. Example: a(3)=26 because the positions of the right-to-left minima in the permutations 123,132,213,231,312 and 321 are 123, 13, 23, 3, 23 and 3, respectively and 1+2+3+1+3+2+3+3+2+3+3=26.
a(n) = sum(k*A143947(n,k), k = n..n*(n+1)/2). (End)

a(n) is the total number of cycles (excluding fixed points) in all permutations of [n+1]. [_Olivier Gérard_, Oct 23 2012; Dec 31 2012]
A length n sequence is formed by randomly selecting (one-by-one) n real numbers in (0,1).  a(n)/(n+1)! is the expected value of the sum of the new maximums in such a sequence.  For example for n=3: If we select (in this order): 0.591996, 0.646474, 0.163659  we would add 0.591996 + 0.646474 which would be a bit above the average of a(3)/4! = 26/24. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Oct 17 2013

Define a unit column of a binary matrix to be a column with only one 1. a(n) = number of 3 X n binary matrices with 1 unit column up to row and column permutations (if offset is 1). - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Sep 09 2000
Generally, number of 3 X n binary matrices with k=0,1,2,... unit columns, up to row and column permutations, is the coefficient of x^k in 1/6*(Z(S_n; 5 + 3*x,5 + 3*x^2, ...) + 3*Z(S_n; 3 + x,5 + 3*x^2,3 + x^3,5 + 3*x^4, ...) + 2*Z(S_n; 2,2,5 + 3*x^3,2,2,5 + 3*x^6, ...)), where Z(S_n; x_1,x_2,...,x_n) is the cycle index of symmetric group S_n of degree n.
First differences of a(n) give number of minimal 3-covers of an unlabeled n-set that cover 4 points of that set uniquely (if offset is 4).

PROPERTIES: 
With offset 1, a(n) = number of labeled plane trees (A006963) on n vertices in which vertices of degree d come in d colors or, equivalently, each vertex has a favorite neighbor (n>=2). For example, there are 2 unlabeled plane trees with 4 vertices: the path and the star. There are 4!/2 ways to label the path and 4!/3 ways to label the star. There are 4 choices for coloring vertices in the path and 3 choices for coloring vertices in the star. The count for 4 vertices is thus 12*4 + 8*3 = 72. [_David Callan_, Aug 22 2014]

With B(x,t)=x+t*x^3, the comp. inverse in x about 0 is A(x,t) = Sum_{j>=0} a(j) (-t)^j x^(2j+1). Let U(x,t)=(x-A(x,t))/t. Then DU(x,t)/Dt=dU/dt+U*dU/dx=0 and U(x,0)=x^3, i.e., U is a solution of the inviscid Burgers's, or Hopf, equation. Also U(x,t)=U(x-t*U(x,t),0) and dB(x,t)/dt = U(B(x,t),t) = x^3 = U(x,0). The characteristics for the Hopf equation are x(t) = x(0)+t*U(x(t),t) = x(0)+t*U(x(0),0) = x(0)+t*x(0)^3 = B(x(0),t). These results apply to all the Fuss-Catalan sequences with 3 replaced by n>0 and 2 by n-1 (e.g., A000108 with n=2 and A002293 with n=4), see also A086810, which can be generalized to A133437, for associahedra. - _Tom Copeland_, Feb 15 2014

By analytic continuation to the entire complex plane there exist regularized values for divergent sums:
a(n)/A060818(n) = (-2)^n*sqrt(Pi)/(Gamma(1/2 - n)*Gamma(1 + n)).
Sum_{k>=0} a(k)/A060818(k) = -i.
Sum_{k>=0} (-1)^k*a(k)/A060818(k) = 1/sqrt(3).
Sum_{k>=0} (-1)^(k+1)*a(k)/A060818(k) = -1/sqrt(3).
a(n)/A046161(n)=(-1)^n*sqrt(Pi)/(Gamma(1/2 - n)*Gamma(1 + n)).
Sum_{k>=0} (-1)^k*a(k)/A046161(k) = 1/sqrt(2).
Sum_{k>=0} (-1)^(k+1)*a(k)/A046161(k) = -1/sqrt(2). (End)
a(n) = numerator of the integral (1/Pi) int(1/(x^2+1)^n, x=-infinity..+infinity). (n=1 is the Cauchy distribution.) - Harry Garst, May 26 2017

a(n) is the number of length-2n binary sequences that contain a subsequence of ones with length n or more. To derive this result, note that there are 2^n sequences where the initial one of the subsequence occurs at entry one. If the initial one of the subsequence occurs at entry 2, 3, ..., or n + 1, there are 2^(n-1) sequences since a zero must precede the initial one. Hence a(n) = 2^n + n*2^(n-1)=(n+2)2^(n-1). An example is given in the example section below. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Oct 25 2012

The shifted array belongs to an interpolated family of arrays associated to the Catalan A000108 (t=1), and Riordan, or Motzkin sums A005043 (t=0), with the interpolating o.g.f. (1-sqrt(1-4x/(1+(1-t)x)))/2 and inverse x(1-x)/(1+(t-1)x(1-x)). See A091867 for more info on this family. Here the interpolation is t=-3 (mod signs in the results).
Let C(x) = (1 - sqrt(1-4x))/2, an o.g.f. for the Catalan numbers A000108, with inverse Cinv(x) = x*(1-x) and P(x,t) = x/(1+t*x) with inverse P(x,-t).
Shifted o.g.f: G(x) = x*(1-x)/(1 - 4x*(1-x)) = P[Cinv(x),-4].
Inverse o.g.f: Ginv(x) = [1 - sqrt(1 - 4*x/(1+4x))]/2 = C[P(x, 4)] (signed shifted A001700). Cf. A030528.

PROPERTIES: 
a(n) = n!n(n-1)/4 gives the total number of inversions in all the permutations of [n]. [Stern, Terquem] Proof: For fixed i,j and for fixed I,J (i<j, I>J, 1 <= i,j,I,J <= n), we have (n-2)! permutations p of [n] for which p(i)=I and p(j)=J (permute {1,2,...,n} \ {I,J} in the positions (1,2,...,n) \ {i,j}). There are n(n-1)/2 choices for the pair (i,j) with i<j and n(n-1)/2 choices for the pair (I,J) with I>J. Consequently, the total number of inversions in all the permutations of [n] is (n-2)![n(n-1)/2]^2 = n!n(n-1)/4. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Oct 05 2006
To state this another way, a(n) is the number of occurrences of the pattern 12 in all permutations of [n]. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 12 2014

Define a "downgrade" to be the permutation which places the items of a permutation in descending order. We are concerned with permutations that are identical to their downgrades. Only permutations of order 4n and 4n+1 can have this property; the number of permutations of length 4n having this property are equinumerous with those of length 4n+1. If a permutation p has this property then the reversal of this permutation also has it. a(n) = number of permutations of length 4n and 4n+1 that are identical to their downgrades. - Eugene McDonnell (eemcd(AT)mac.com), Oct 26 2003

From _Tom Copeland_, Nov 15 2014: (Start)
Aerated with intervening zeros (1,0,2,0,12,0,120,...)=a(n) (cf. A123023 and A001147), the e.g.f. is e^(t^2), so this is the base for the Appell sequence with e.g.f. e^(t^2) e^(x*t) = exp(P(.,x),t) (reverse A059344, cf. A099174, A066325 also). P(n,x) = (a. + x)^n with (a.)^n = a_n and comprise the umbral compositional inverses for e^(-t^2)e^(x*t) = exp(UP(.,x),t), i.e., UP(n,P(.,t))= x^n = P(n,UP(.,t)), e.g., (P(.,t))^n = P(n,t).

For n divisible by 4, a(n/4) is the number of ways to place n points on an n X n grid with pairwise distinct abscissae, pairwise distinct ordinates, and 90-degree rotational symmetry. For n == 1 (mod 4), the number of ways is a((n-1)/4) because the center point can be considered "fixed".

In general the unique inverse of such a nonzero vector v (odd element in Cl_2) is v^(-1) = (1/|v|^2) v. Note that the inverse with respect to the scalar product is not unique for any nonzero vector.

Comment from Ben Thurston, Feb 18 2013: In the plane, if you make a picture by taking one unit step in each of the basic 8 directions from a central dot, then from each of those going one unit step in each of the eight directions, ... (see illustration), it appears that the number of dots in the picture after n steps is equal to a(n). Response from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 19 2013: This is correct, and follows from the fact that the Z-module Z[1,i,(+-1+i)/sqrt(2)] is essentially a copy of the Z^4 lattice.

Convolution of F(2n+1) (A001519) and F(2n+2) (A001906(n+1)). - _Graeme McRae_, Jun 07 2006
Number of reentrant corners along the lower contours of all directed column-convex polyominoes of area n+3 (a reentrant corner along the lower contour is a vertical step that is followed by a horizontal step). a(n) = Sum(k*A121466(n+3,k), k=0..ceil((n+1)/2)). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 02 2006
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 02 2012: (Start)
a(n) = A024458(2*n), n>=1 (bisection, even arguments).
a(n) is also the odd part of the bisection of the half-convolution of the sequence A000045(n+1), n>=0, with itself. See a comment on A201204 for the definition of the half-convolution of a sequence with itself. There one also finds the rule for the o.g.f. which in this case is Chato(x)/2 with the o.g.f. Chato(x)=2*(1-x)/(1-3*x+x^2)^2 of A001629(2*n+3), n>=0.

From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 06 2008: (Start)
a(n) is the denominator of the n-th approximant to the continued fraction 1^2/(6+3^2/(6+5^2/(6+... for Pi-3. W. Lang, Oct 06 2008, after an e-mail from R. Rosenthal. Cf. A142970 for the corresponding numerators.
The e.g.f. g(x)=(1+x)/(1-2*x)^(5/2) satisfies (1-4*x^2)*g''(x) - 2*(8*x+3)*g'(x) -9*g(x) = 0 (from the three term recurrence given below). Also g(x)=hypergeom([2,3/2],[1],2*x). (End)
Number of descents in all fixed-point-free involutions of {1,2,...,2(n+1)}. A descent of a permutation p is a position i such that p(i) > p(i+1). Example: a(1)=6 because the fixed-point-free involutions 2143, 3412, and 4321 have 2, 1, and 3 descents, respectively. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 05 2009

|A001896(n)|*pi^(2n)/A001897(n) is the value of the multi zeta function z(2,2,...,2) with n 2's, where z(k_l,k_2,...,k_n) = sum_{i_n >= i_(n-1) >= ... >= i_1 >= 1}1/((i_1)^k_1 (i_2)^k_2 ... (i_n)^k_n). The proof is simple: start with the product expansion sin(pi x)/(pi x) = product_{r>=1}(1-x^2/r^2), take reciprocals, and expand the right side. The coefficient of x^(2n) is seen to be z(2,2,...,2) with n 2's. - _David Callan_, Aug 27 2014

a(n+1) is the number of spanning trees of the graph T_n, where T_n is a sequence of n triangles, where adjacent triangles share an edge. - _Kevin Long_, May 07 2018
a(n) is the number of ways to partition [n] such that each block is a run of consecutive numbers, and each block has a fixed point, e.g., for n=3, 12|3 with 1 and 3 as fixed points is valid, but 13|2 is not valid as 1 and 3 do not form a run. Consequently, a(n) also counts the spanning trees of the graph given by taking a path with n vertices and adding another vertex adjacent to all of them. - _Kevin Long_, May 11 2018
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 31 2018: (Start)
The preceding comment can be paraphrased as follows. a(n) is the row sum of the array A305309 for n >= 1. The array A305309(n, k) gives the sum of the products of the block lengths of the set partition of [n] := {1, 2, ..., n} with A048996(n, k) blocks of consecutive numbers, corresponding to the compositions obtained from the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order. See the comments and examples at A305309.
{a(n)} also gives the infinite sequence of nonnegative numbers k for which k * ||k*phi|| < 1/sqrt(5), where the irrational number phi = A001622 (golden section), and ||x|| is the absolute value of the difference between x and the nearest integer.

a(n+3)=:b(n), n>=1, enumerates the ways to distribute n beads labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and four indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as a beadless cords contribute each a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., b(0):= 1*1 =1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads.
This produces for b(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and the sequence {A001715 (n+3)}. See the necklaces and cords problem comment in A000153. Therefore also the recurrence b(n) = (n+3)*b(n-1) + (n-1)*b(n-2) with b(-1)=0 and b(0)=1 holds.

a(n+4)=:b(n), n>=1, enumerates the ways to distribute n beads labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and k=5 indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as a beadless cords contribute each a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., b(0):= 1*1 =1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads.
This produces for b(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and the sequence {A001720(n+4) = (n+4)!/4!}. See the necklaces and cords problem comment in A000153. Therefore also the recurrence b(n) = (n+4)*b(n-1) + (n-1)*b(n-2) with b(-1)=0 and b(0)=1 holds.

For example, (7-11) in Fibonacci Maximal = (1010, 1011, 1101, 1110, 1111), numbers of leading 1's = (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 11 = a(4) = row 4 of triangle A181631. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Nov 02 2010
As in our 2009 paper, we use two types of Fibonacci trees: - Ta: Fibonacci analog of binomial trees; Tb: Binary Fibonacci trees. Let D(r(k)) be the sum over all distances of the form d(r, x), across all vertices x of the tree rooted at r of order k. Ignoring r, but overloading, let D(a(k)) and D(b(k)) be the distance sums for the Fibonacci trees Ta and Tb respectively of the order k. Using the sum-of-product form in Equations (18) and (21) in our paper it follows that F(k+4) - 2 = D(a(k+1)) - D(b(k-1)). - _K.V.Iyer_ and P. Venkata Subba Reddy, Apr 30 2011

Primes p such that the corresponding entry in A002371 is p-1.
Pieter Moree writes (Oct 20 2004): Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis it can be shown that the density of primes p such that a prescribed integer g has order (p-1)/t, with t fixed exists and, moreover, it can be computed. This density will be a rational number times the so called Artin constant. For 2 and 10 the density of primitive roots is A, the Artin constant itself.

Comments from _Richard Choulet_, Aug 14 2007: For n>=4 a(n-4) is the resultant of the polynomials x^3-x-1 and x^(n+1)-x^n-1. For n=4 in fact the result is 0 as we see from the identity x^5-x^4-1=(x^3-x-1)(x^2-x+1). The characteristic polynomial of the sequence is x^6+x^5-x^4-3x^3-x^2+x+1 = (x^3-x-1)*(x^3+x^2-1).

If we define a base-phi integer as a positive number whose representation in the golden ratio base consists only of nonnegative powers of phi, and if these base-phi integers are ordered in increasing order (beginning 1, phi, ...), then it appears that the difference between the n-th and (n-1)-th base-phi integer is phi-1 if and only if n belongs to this sequence, and the difference is 1 otherwise. Further, if each base-phi integer is written in linear form as a + b*phi (for example, phi^2 is written as 1 + phi), then it appears that there are exactly two base-phi integers with b=n if and only if n belongs to this sequence, and exactly three base-phi integers with b=n otherwise. - _Geoffrey Caveney_, Apr 17 2014

These are the nonnegative integers m satisfying sin(m*Pi/r)*sin((m+1)*Pi/r) <= 0, where r = sqrt(2). In general, the Beatty sequence of an irrational number r > 1 consists of the numbers m satisfying sin(m*x)*sin((m+1)*x) <= 0, where x = Pi/r. Thus the numbers m satisfying sin(m*x)*sin((m+1)*x) > 0 form the Beatty sequence of r/(1-r). - _Clark Kimberling_, Aug 21 2014

We can generate A001951 and A001952 without using sqrt(2).  First write the even positive integers in a row:
2   4   6   8   10   12   14 . . .
Then put 1 under 2 and add:
2   4   6   8   10   12   14 . . .
1
3
Next, under 4, put the least positive integer that is not yet in rows 2 and
3; that is 2; and add, getting
2   4   6   8   10   12   14 . . .
1   2
3   6
Next, under the 6 in row 1, put the least positive integer not yet in rows 2 and 3; that is 4, and add:
2   4   6   8   10   12   14 . . .
1   2   4

a(n)-A001285(n) = 2n-1 has been verified for n=0..400. - _John W. Layman_
First differences give A036585. Observed by _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, proved by _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 30 2006. This is equivalent to a(n) = 2*n + A010060(n). Proof: If the number of bits in n is odd then the last bit of a(n) is 1 and if the number of bits in n is even then the last bit of a(n) is 0. Hence the sequence of last bits is A010060. Therefore a(n) = 2*n + A010060(n).

Conjecture, checked up to 10^6: a(n) is also the sequence of numbers k representable as k = ror(x) XOR rol(x) (for some integer x) where ror(x)=A038572(x) is x rotated one binary place to the right, rol(x)=A006257(x) is x rotated one binary place to the left, and XOR is the binary exclusive-or operator. - _Alex Ratushnyak_, May 14 2016
From _Charlie Neder_, Oct 07 2018: (Start)
Conjecture is true: ror(x) and rol(x) have an even number of 1 bits in total (= 2 * A000120(x)), and XOR preserves the parity of this total, so the resulting number must have an even number of 1 bits. An x can be constructed corresponding to a(n) like so:
If the number of bits in a(n) is even, add a leading 0 so a(n) is 2k+1 bits long.
Do an inverse shuffle on a(n), then "divide" by 11, rotate the result k bits to the right, and shuffle to get x. (End)

a(n) = number of partitions of n, when for each k there are p(k) different copies of part k. E.g., let the parts be 1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, ... Then the a(4) = 14 partitions of 4 are: 4 = 4a = 4b = ... = 4e = 3a+1 = 3b+1 = 3c+1 = 2a+2a = 2a+2b = 2b+2b = 2a+1 = 2b+1 = 1+1+1+1.
Equivalently (Cayley), a(n) = number of 2-dimensional partitions of n. E.g., for n = 4 we have:

PROPERTIES: 
The wire is marked into n equal segments by n-1 marks, is bent at right angles at each of one or more of these points, making each segment parallel to one of two rectangular axes. (Stays in plane, bends are of 0 or +-90 degs.) May cross itself but is not self-coincident over a finite length.
A trail is a path which may cross itself but does not reuse an edge. This sequence counts undirected trails on the square lattice up to rotation and reflection. Directed trails are counted by A006817.
Much less is known about the three-dimensional problem.


NAME: Bending a piece of wire of length n+1; walks of length n+1 on a tetrahedron; also non-branched catafusenes with n+2 condensed hexagons.
SEQUENCE: 1,2,4,10,25,70,196,574,1681,5002,14884,44530,133225,399310,1196836,3589414,10764961,32291602,96864964,290585050,871725625,2615147350,7845353476,23535971854,70607649841,211822683802,635467254244,1906400965570,5719200505225,17157599124190
PROPERTIES: 
The wire stays in the plane, there are n bends, each is R,L or O; turning the wire over does not count as a new figure.
Equivalently, walks of n+1 steps on a tetrahedron, visiting n+2 vertices, with n "corners"; the symmetry group is S4, reversing a walk does not count as different. Simply interpret R,L,O as instructions to turn R, turn L, or retrace the last step. Walks are not self-avoiding.
Also, it appears that a(n) gives the number of equivalence classes of n-tuples of 0, 1 and 2, where two n-tuples are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations R and C, where R denotes reversal and C denotes taking the 2's complement (C(x)=2-x). This has been verified up to a(19)=290585050. Example: for n=3 there are ten equivalence classes {000, 222}, {001, 100, 122, 221}, {002, 022, 200, 220}, {010, 212}, {011, 110, 112, 211}, {012, 210}, {020, 202}, {021, 102, 120, 201}, {101, 121}, {111}, so a(3)=10. - _John W. Layman_, Oct 13 2009
There exists a bijection between chains of n+2 hexagons and the above described equivalence classes of n-tuples of 0,1, and 2. Namely, for a given chain of n+2 hexagons we take the sequence of the numbers of vertices of degree 2 (0, 1, or 2) between the consecutive contact vertices on one side of the chain; switching to the other side we obtain the 2's complement of this sequence; reversing the order of the hexagons, we obtain the reverse sequence. The inverse mapping is straightforward. For example, to a linear chain of 7 hexagons there corresponds the 5-tuple 11111. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Apr 22 2013
If we treat two wire bends (or walks, or tuples) related by turning over (or reversing) as different in any of the above-given interpretations of this sequence, we get A007051 (or A124302). Also, a(n-1) is the sum of first 3 terms in n-th row of A284949, see crossrefs therein. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Sep 29 2017
a(n-1) is the number of color patterns (set partitions) in an unoriented row of length n using 3 or fewer colors (subsets). - _Robert A. Russell_, Oct 28 2018

PROPERTIES: 
The present sequence is the case x = 3 of the following general remarks. For other cases see A219160 (x = 4), A219161 (x = 5) and A112845 (x = 6).
Let x > 2 and let alpha := {x + sqrt(x^2 - 4)}/2. Define a sequence a(n) (which depends on x) by setting a(n) = alpha^(3^n) + (1/alpha)^(3^n). Then it is easy to verify that the sequence a(n) satisfies the recurrence equation a(n+1) = a(n)^3 - 3*a(n) with the initial condition a(0) = x.
We have the following identity, valid for x > 2: sqrt((x + 2)/(x - 2)) = (1 + 2/(x-1))*sqrt((y + 2)/(y - 2)), where y = x^3 - 3*x. Iterating the identity produces the product expansion sqrt((x+2)/(x-2)) = product {n = 0..inf} (1 + 2/(a(n) - 1)), with a(0) = x and a(n+1) = a(n)^3 - 3*a(n). The rate of convergence is cubic (Fine).
For similar results to the above see A001566 and A219162.

PROPERTIES: 
From _Peter M. Chema_, Mar 02 2017: (Start)
Number of rods (line segments) required to make a Sierpinski tetrahedron of side length 2^n.
Also equals the number of balls (vertices) in a Sierpinski tetrahedron of side length 2^n+1 minus the number of balls in a Sierpinski tetrahedron of side length 2^n (the first difference in the tetrix numbers). See formula. (End)
Equivalently, the number of edges in the (n+1)-Sierpinski tetrahedron graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Aug 17 2017

For any n >= 0, a(n+1) is the least integer m such that A000217(m)=m(m+1)/2 is larger than n. This is useful when enumerating representations of n as difference of triangular numbers; see also A234813. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 19 2014
Number of binary digits of A023758, i.e., a(n) = ceiling(log_2(A023758(n+2))). - _Andres Cicuttin_, Apr 29 2016

PROPERTIES: 
Number of ordered trees with n+1 edges, having root of degree 2 and nonroot nodes of outdegree at most 2.
Sequence without the initial 0 is the convolution of the sequence of Motzkin numbers (A001006) with itself.
Number of horizontal steps at level zero in all Motzkin paths of length n. Example: a(3)=5 because in the four Motzkin paths of length 3, (HHH), (H)UD, UD(H) and UHD, where H=(1,0), U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), we have altogether five horizontal steps H at level zero (shown in parentheses).
Number of peaks at level 1 in all Motzkin paths of length n+1. Example: a(3)=5 because in the nine Motzkin paths of length 4, HHHH, HH(UD), H(UD)H, HUHD, (UD)HH, (UD)(UD), UHDH, UHHD and UUDD (where H=(1,0), U=(1,1), D=(1,-1)), we have five peaks at level 1 (shown between parentheses).
a(n) = number of Motzkin paths of length n+1 that start with an up step. - _David Callan_, Jul 19 2004
Could be called a Motzkin transform of A130716 because the g.f. is obtained from the g.f. x*A130716(x)= x(1+x+x^2) (offset changed to 1) by the substitution x -> x*A001006(x) of the independent variable. [_R. J. Mathar_, Nov 08 2008]

a(n) = CatalanNumber(n+3) - 2*CatalanNumber(n+2). Proof. From its definition as a convolution of Catalan numbers, a(n) counts lists of 4 Dyck paths of total size (semilength) = n. Connect the 4 paths by 3 upsteps (U) and append 3 downsteps (D). This is a reversible procedure. So a(n) is also the number of Dyck (n+3)-paths that end DDD (D for downstep). Let C(n) denote CatalanNumber(n) (A000108). Since C(n+3) is the total number of Dyck (n+3)-paths and C(n+2) is the number that end UD, we have (*) C(n+3) - C(n+2) is the number of Dyck (n+3)-paths that end DD. Also, (**) C(n+2) is the number of Dyck (n+3)-paths that end UDD (change the last D in a Dyck (n+2)-path to UDD). Subtracting (**) from (*) yields a(n) = C(n+3) - 2C(n+2) as claimed. - _David Callan_, Nov 21 2006

With offset 4, a(n) is the number of permutations on {1,2,...,n} that are 123-avoiding, i.e., do not contain a three-term monotone subsequence, for which the first ascent is at positions (4,5); for example, there are 48 123-avoiding permutations on n=7 for which the first ascent is at spots (4,5). See Connolly link. There it is shown in general that the k-th Catalan Convolution is the number of 123-avoiding permutations for which the first ascent is at (k, k+1). (For n=k, the first ascent is defined to be at positions (k,k+1) if the permutation is the decreasing permutation with no ascents.) - _Anant Godbole_, Jan 17 2014

Ignoring the first ones, these are rectangular parallelepipeds with integer dimensions that have integer interior diagonals. Using Pythagoras: sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = d, an integer; then this sequence: sqrt(n^2 + (n+1)^2 + (n(n+1))^2) = 2T_n + 1 is the first and most simple example. Problem: Are there any integer diagonals which do not satisfy the following general formula? sqrt((k*n)^2 + (k*(n+(2*m+1)))^2 + (k*(n*(n+(2*m+1)) + 4*T_m))^2) = k*d where m >= 0, k >= 1, and T is a triangular number. - _Marco Matosic_, Nov 10 2006

a(n) is also the Wiener index of the fan graph F(n). The fan graph F(n) is defined as the graph obtained by joining each node of an n-node path graph with an additional node. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of the distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph. The Wiener polynomial of the graph F(n) is (1/2)t[(n-1)(n-2)t + 2(2n-1)]. Example: a(2)=3 because the corresponding fan graph is a cycle on 3 nodes (a triangle), having distances 1, 1, and 1.

For all elements k = n^2 - n + 1 of the sequence, sqrt(4*(k-1)+1) is an integer because 4*(k-1) + 1 = (2*n-1)^2 is a perfect square. Building the intersection of this sequence with A000225, k may in addition be of the form k = 2^x - 1, which happens only for k = 1, 3, 7, 31, and 8191. [Proof: Still 4*(k-1)+1 = 2^(x+2) - 7 must be a perfect square, which has the finite number of solutions provided by A060728: x = 1, 2, 3, 5, or 13.] In other words, the sequence A038198 defines all elements of the form 2^x - 1 in this sequence. For example k = 31 = 6*6 - 6 + 1; sqrt((31-1)*4+1) = sqrt(121) = 11 = A038198(4). - _Alzhekeyev Ascar M_, Jun 01 2011

Starting with b(1) = 1 and not allowing the digit 0, let b(n) = smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence such that the last digit of b(n-1) plus the first digit of b(n) is equal to k for k = 1, ..., 9. This defines 9 finite sequences, each of length equal to a(k), k = 1, ..., 9. (See A289283-A289287 for the cases k = 5..9.) For k = 10, the sequence is infinite (A289288). For example, for k = 4, b(n) = 1,3,11,31,32,2,21,33,12,22,23,13,14. These terms can be ordered in the following array of size k*(k-1)+1:

These are squares that can be expressed as sum of exactly two distinct powers of two. For instance, a(4) = 9*4^4 = 2304 = 2^11 + 2^8 . It is conjectured that these are the only squares with this characteristic (tested on squares up to (10^7)^2). - _Andres Cicuttin_, Apr 23 2016
Conjecture is true. It is equivalent to prove that the Diophantine equation m^2 = 2^k*(1+2^h), where h>0, has solutions only when h=3. Dividing by 2^k we must obtain an odd square on the left, since 1+2^h is odd, so we can write (2*r+1)^2 = 1+2^h. Expanding, we have 4*r*(r+1) = 2^h, from which it follows that r must be equal to 1 and thus h=3, since r and r+1 must be powers of 2. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 27 2017

Conjectures:
a(n) is the Hafnian of the triangular array (u(i,j))_{1 <= i < j <= 2n} with u(i,j)=i. The Hafnian is the same as the Pfaffian except without the alternating signs just as the permanent of a matrix is the determinant without the signs.
a(n) is the total weight of Dyck n-paths with weight defined as follows. Given a Dyck path, for each upstep, record its position in the path and the height of its upper endpoint; then multiply together all of these positions and heights. For example, the Dyck 4-path P = UUDUUDDD has upsteps in positions 1,2,4,5 ending at heights 1,2,2,3 respectively, and hence weight(P) = 480.

Compositions p(1) + p(2) + ... + p(k) = n of n into positive parts p(i) with p(1)=1 and p(k) <= Sum_{j=1..k-1} p(j), see example - Claude Lenormand (claude.lenormand(AT)free.fr), Jan 29 2001 (clarified by _Joerg Arndt_, Feb 01 2013)
a(n) = number of sequences (b(1),b(2),...) of unspecified length satisfying b(1) = 1, 1 <= b(i) <= 1 + Sum[b(j),{j,i-1}] for i>=2, Sum[b(i)] = n-1.

a(n+1) is the number of padded compositions (d_1,d_2,...,d_n) of n satisfying d_i <= i for all i. A padded composition of n is obtained from an ordinary composition (c_1,c_2,...,c_r) of n (r >= 1, each c_i >= 1, Sum_{i=1..r} c_i = n) by inserting c_i - 1 zeros immediately after each c_i. Thus (3,1,2) -> (3,0,0,1,2,0) is a padded composition of 6 and a padded composition of n has length n. For example, with n=4, a(5) counts (1,1,1,1), (1,1,2,0), (1,2,0,1). - _David Callan_, Feb 04 2006

PROPERTIES: 
A stronger version of the second Goldbach conjecture (every odd number can be expressed as the sum of 3 primes) states that every odd number n > 5 can be written as n = 2*p + q, p, q prime. The conjecture was posed by E. Lemoine and later by H. Levy. The article by B.H. Mayoh assumes q {1,prime}. For the representations of n minimizing q, the sequence gives the value of n at which a larger q than for all representations of j<n is required. The new record value of q is given in A002092. The corresponding sequences for q prime and q=1 excluded are A194828 and A194829. - Hugo Pfoertner, Sep 03 2011

SEQUENCE: 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,16,18,20,24,30,36,42,48,60,72,84,90,96,108,120,144,168,180,210,216,240,288,300,336,360,420,480,504,540,600,630,660,720,840,960,1008,1080,1200,1260,1440,1560,1620,1680,1800,1920,1980,2100

Numbers n such that sum of the even divisors of 2*n is a record. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Jul 12 2012
Conjecture: (a) Every highly abundant number >10 is practical (A005153). (b) For every integer k there exists A such that k divides a(n) for all n>A. Daniel Fischer proved that every highly abundant number greater than 3, 20, 630 is divisible by 2, 6, 12 respectively. The first conjecture has been verified for the first 10000 terms. - _Jaycob Coleman_, Oct 16 2013
Conjecture: For each term k: (1) Let p be the largest prime less than k (if one exists) and let q be the smallest prime greater than k; then k-p is either 1 or a prime, and q-k is either 1 or a prime. (2) The closest prime number p<k located to a distance d=(k-p)>1 is also always at a prime distance. These would mean that the even highly abundant numbers greater than 2 have always at least a Goldbach pair of primes. h=p+d. Both observations verified for the first 10000 terms. - _David Morales Marciel_, Jan 04 2016

The original definition in A Handbook of Integer Sequences (1973) based on Schiff (1875) was simply "Alcohols". - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 22 2018
Schiff used an now outdated terminology and did not use the term "alcohols", but in German "zweiwerthige Kohlenwasserstoffe C_{n}H_{2n} ..." and later ".. deren je zwei verfuegbare Affinitaeten ... durch Alkoholradikale befriedigt sind.", translated "bivalent hydrocarbons  ... whose free valences ... are covered by alcohol radicals". At that time the meaning of "alcohol radical" was different from modern terminology, now meaning an -OH group, but in Schiff's terminology another C_{x}H{y} hydrocarbon group was meant. The organic compounds that are described by the graphs of this sequence in modern chemical terminology are the acyclic alkenes, with exactly one double carbon-to-carbon bond, and the monocyclic cycloalkanes  (see Wikipedia links). - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Mar 29 2018

"For example, for n=3, there are 4 possibilities: 123123, 121323, 132312 and 132132 and indeed a(3) = 4. This is the work of my Ph. D. student Nan Zang. See also A117513, A117514, A117515.

a(n) = number of increasing full binary trees on vertex set [2n-1] with the left-largest property: the largest descendant of each non-leaf vertex occurs in its left subtree (Poupard). The first Mathematica recurrence below counts these trees by number 2k-1 of vertices in the left subtree of the root: the root is necessarily labeled 1 and n necessarily occurs in the left subtree and so there are Binomial[2n-3,2k-2] ways to choose the remaining labels for the left subtree. - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2007

These numbers are divisible by their digital roots, which makes the sequence a subsequence of A064807. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Oct 08 2013
The above comment from Parthasarathy Nambi follows from the observation that digit summing produces a congruent number mod 9, so the digital root of any multiple of 3 is a multiple of 3. p(n)# is divisible by 3 for n >= 2. - _Christian Schulz_, Oct 30 2013
The peaks (i.e., local maximums) in a graph of the number of repetitions (i.e., the tally of values) vs. value, as generated by taking the differences of all distinct pairs of odd prime numbers within a contiguous range occur at regular periodic intervals given by the primorial numbers 6 and greater. Larger primorials yield larger (relative) peaks, however the range must be >50% larger than the primorial to be easily observed. Secondary peaks occur at intervals of those "near-primorials" divisible by 6 (e.g., 42). See A259629. Also, periodicity at intervals of 6 and 30 can be observed in the local peaks of all possible sums of two, three or more distinct odd primes within modest contiguous ranges starting from p(2) = 3. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jul 01 2015

If a number k and a(n) are coprime and k < (prime(n+1))^b < a(n), where b is an integer, then k has fewer than b prime factors, counting multiplicity (i.e., bigomega(k) < b, cf. A001222). - _Isaac Saffold_, Dec 03 2017
If n > 0, then a(n) has 2^n unitary divisors (A034444), and a(n) is a record; i.e., if k < a(n) then k has fewer unitary divisors than a(n) has. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jun 26 2018

PROPERTIES: 
Sometimes called Apery's constant.
"A natural question is whether Zeta(3) is a rational multiple of Pi^3. This is not known, though in 1978 R. Apery succeeded in proving that Zeta(3) is irrational. In Chapter 8 we pointed out that the probability that two random integers are relatively prime is 6/Pi^2, which is 1/Zeta(2). This generalizes to: The probability that k random integers are relatively prime is 1/Zeta(k) ... ." [Stan Wagon]
In 2001 Tanguy Rivoal showed that there are infinitely many odd (positive) integers at which zeta is irrational, including at least one value j in the range 5 <= j <= 21 (refined the same year by Zudilin to 5 <= j <= 11), at which zeta(j) is irrational. See the Rivoal link for further information and references.
The reciprocal of this constant is the probability that three integers chosen randomly using uniform distribution are relatively prime. - Joseph Biberstine (jrbibers(AT)indiana.edu), Apr 13 2005

Absolute values give denominators of successive convergents to e using continued fraction 1+2/(1+1/(6+1/(10+1/(14+1/(18+1/(22+1/26...)))))).
Absolute values give number of different arrangements of nonnegative integers on a set of n 6-sided dice such that the dice can add to any integer from 0 to 6^n-1. For example when n=2, there are 7 arrangements that can result in any total from 0 to 35. Cf. A273013. The number of sides on the dice only needs to be the product of two distinct primes, of which 6 is the first example. - _Elliott Line_, Jun 10 2016

a(n) is the number of collections of necklaces created by using exactly n different colored beads (to make the entire collection). - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Apr 19 2009
a(n) is the number of ways that a deck with 2 cards of each of n types may be dealt into n hands of 2 cards each, assuming that the order of the hands and the order of the cards in each hand are irrelevant.  See the Art of Problem Solving link for proof. - _Joel B. Lewis_, Sep 30 2012
From _Bruce Westbury_, Jan 22 2013: (Start)
It follows from the respective exponential generating functions that A002135 is the binomial transform of A002137:
A002135(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)*A002137(k),
2 = 1.1 + 2.0 + 1.1,
5 = 1.1 + 3.0 + 3.1 + 1.1,
17 = 1.1 + 4.0 + 6.1 + 4.1 + 1.6, ...
A002137 arises from looking at the dimension of the space of invariant tensors of the r-th tensor power of the adjoint representation of the symplectic group Sp(2n) (for n large compared to r).
(End)
a(n) is the number of representations required for the symbolic central moments of order 2 for the multivariate normal distribution, that is,   E[X1^2 X2^2 .. Xn^2|mu=0, Sigma] (Phillips 2010). These representations are the upper-triangular, positive integer matrices for which for each i, the sum of the i-th row and i-th column equals 2, the power of each component. This can be shown starting from the formulation by Joel B Lewis. See "Proof for multivariate normal moments" link below for a proof. - _Kem Phillips_, Aug 20 2014
Equivalent to Critzer's comment, a(n) is the number of ways to cover n labeled vertices by disjoint undirected cycles, hence the exponential transform of A001710(n - 1). - _Gus Wiseman_, Oct 20 2018

From _Victor S. Miller_, Apr 26 2013: (Start)
A002137 also is the number of monomials in the determinant of a generic n X n symmetric matrix with 0's on the diagonal (see the paper of Aitken).
It is also the number of monomials in the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.  Even though this matrix is symmetric with 0's on the diagonal, it has 1's in the first row and column and so requires an extra argument.

Highly composite numbers are the product of primorials, A002110. See A112779 for the number of primorial terms in the product of a highly composite number. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 12 2005
Sigma and tau for highly composite numbers through the 146th entry conform to a power fit as follows: log(sigma)=A*log(tau)^B where (A,B) =~ (1.45,1.38). - _Bill McEachen_, May 24 2006
a(n) often corresponds to P(n,m) = number of permutations of n things taken m at a time. Specifically, if start=1, pointers 1-6, 9, 10, 13-15, 17-19, 22, 23, 28, 34, 37, 43, 52, ... An example is a(37)=665280, which is P(12,6)=12!/(12-6)!. - _Bill McEachen_, Feb 09 2009
Concerning the previous comment, if m=1, then P(n,m) can represent any number. So let's assume m > 1. Searching the first 1000 terms, the only indices of terms of the form P(n,m) are 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 34, 37, 41, 43, 44, 47, 50, 52, and 54. Note that a(44) = 4324320 = P(2079,2). See A163264. - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 10 2009
A large number of highly composite numbers have 9 as their digit root. - _Parthasarathy Nambi_, Jun 07 2009
Because 9 divides all highly composite numbers greater than 1680, those numbers have digital root 9. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 24 2009
See A181309 for highly composite numbers that are not highly abundant.
a(n) is also defined by the recurrence: a(1) = 1, a(n+1)/sigma(a(n+1)) < a(n) / sigma(a(n)). - _Michel Lagneau_, Jan 02 2012 [This "definition" is wrong (the term a(20)=7560 does not satisfy this inequality) and incomplete: It does not determine a sequence uniquely, e.g., any subsequence would satisfy the same relation. The intended meaning is probably the definition of the (different) sequence A004394. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 13 2012]
Up to a(1000), the terms beyond a(5)=12 resp. beyond a(9)=60 are a multiples of these. Is this true for all subsequent terms? - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 13 2012
Differs from the superabundant numbers from a(20)=7560 on, which is not in A004394. The latter is not a subsequence of A002182, as might appear from considering the displayed terms: The two sequences have only 449 terms in common, the largest of which is A002182(2567) = A004394(1023). See A166735 for superabundant numbers that are not highly composite, and A004394 for further information. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 13 2012
Subset of A067128. - _David A. Corneth_, May 16 2016
It seems that a(n) +- 1 is often prime. For n <= 1000 there are 210 individual primes and 17 pairs of twin primes. See link to Lim's paper below. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Mar 02 2019

The above series for Euler's constant was discovered circa 1780-1790 by the Italian mathematicians Gregorio Fontana (1735-1803) and Lorenzo Mascheroni (1750-1800), and was subsequently rediscovered several times (in particular, by Ernst Schröder in 1879, Niels E. Nørlund in 1923, Jan C. Kluyver in 1924, Charles Jordan in 1929, Kenter in 1999, and Victor Kowalenko in 2008). For more details, see references [Blagouchine, 2015] and [Blagouchine, 2016] below. - _Iaroslav V. Blagouchine_, Sep 16 2015
From _Peter Bala_, Sep 28 2012: (Start)
Gregory's coefficients {G(n)}n>=0 = {1,1/2,-1/12,1/24,-19/720,3/160,...} occur in Gregory's quadrature formula for numerical integration. The integral I = int {x = m..n} f(x) dx may be approximated by the sum S = 1/2*f(m) + f(m+1) + ... + f(n-1) + 1/2*f(n). Gregory's formula for the difference is
I - S = sum {k = 2..inf} G(k)*{delta^(k-1)(f(n)) - delta^(k-1)(f(m))}, where delta is the difference operator delta(f(x)) = f(x+1) - f(x).
Gregory's formula is the discrete analog of the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, with finite differences replacing derivatives and the Gregory coefficients replacing the Bernoulli numbers.
Alabdulmohsin, Section 7.3.3, gives several identities involving the Gregory coefficients including
Sum_{n >= 2} |G(n)|/(n-1) = (1/2)*(log(2*Pi) - 1 - euler_gamma) and
Sum_{n >= 1} |G(n)|/(n+1) = 1 - log(2).
(End)
More series with Gregory coefficients, accurate bounds for them, their full asymptotics at large index, as well as many historical details related to them, are given in the articles by Blagouchine (see refs. below). - _Iaroslav V. Blagouchine_,  May 06 2016

The upper trim of an arbitrary fractal sequence s is s, but the lower trim of s, although a fractal sequence, need not be s itself. However, the lower trim of A002260 is A002260. (The upper trim of s is what remains after the first occurrence of each term is deleted; the lower trim of s is what remains after all 0s are deleted from the sequence s-1.) - _Clark Kimberling_, Nov 02 2009

From _Peter Bala_, Sep 20 2015: (Start)
Let d be a divisor of a(n). Let m*d be any multiple of d. Split the decimal expansion of m*d into 2 blocks of contiguous digits a and b, so we have m*d = 10^k*a + b for some k, where 0 <= k < number of decimal digits of m*d. Then d divides a^n - (-b)^n (see McGough). For example, 271 divides a(5) and we find 2^5 + 71^5 = 11*73*271*8291 and 27^5 + 1^5 = 2^2*7*31*61*271 are both divisible by 271. Similarly, 4*271 = 1084 and 10^5 + 84^5 = 2^5*31*47*271*331 while 108^5 + 4^5 = 2^12*7*31*61*271 are again both divisible by 271. (End)

The Regan link shows that integers of the form 10^n -1 have binary representations with exactly n trailing 1 bits. Also those integers have quinary expressions with exactly n trailing 4's. For example, 10^4 -1 = (304444)5. The first digits in quinary correspond to the number 2^n -1, in our example (30)5 = 2^4 -1. A similar pattern occurs in the binary case. Consider 9 = (1001)2. - _Washington Bomfim_ Dec 23 2010
a(n) is the number of positive integers with less than n+1 digits. - _Bui Quang Tuan_, Mar 09 2015
From _Peter Bala_, Sep 27 2015: (Start)
For n >= 1, the simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(a(2*n)) = [10^n - 1; 1, 2*(10^n - 1), 1, 2*(10^n - 1), ...] has period 2. The simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(a(2*n))/a(n) = [1; 10^n - 1, 2,  10^n - 1, 2, ...] also has period 2. Note the occurrence of large partial quotients in both expansions.
A theorem of Kuzmin in the measure theory of continued fractions says that large partial quotients are the exception in continued fraction expansions.
Empirically, we also see the presence of unexpectedly large partial quotients early in the continued fraction expansions of the m-th roots of the numbers a(m*n) for m >= 3. Some typical examples are given below. (End)

The product of 2 different terms (x^2 + y^2)(z^2 + v^2) = (xz + yv)^2 + (xv - yz)^2 is sum of 2 squares (A000404) because (xv - yz)^2 > 0. If x were equal to yz/v then (x^2 + y^2)/(z^2 + v^2) would be equal to ((yz/v)^2 + y^2)/(z^2 + v^2) = y^2/v^2 which is not possible because (x^2 + y^2) and (z^2 + v^2) are prime numbers. For example, (2^2 + 5^2)(4^2 + 9^2) = (2*4 + 5*9)^2 + (2*9 - 5*4)^2. - _Jerzy R Borysowicz_, Mar 21 2017

Comment from Igor Shparlinski, Mar 12 2007 (writing to the Number Theory List): Results about the distribution of roots (for arbitrary quadratic polynomials) are given by W. Duke, J. B. Friedlander and H. Iwaniec and A. Toth.
Comment from Emmanuel Kowalski, Mar 12 2007 (writing to the Number Theory List): It is known (Duke, Friedlander, Iwaniec, Annals of Math. 141 (1995)) that the fractional part of a(n)/p(n) is equidistributed in [0,1/2] for p(n)<X and X going to infinity. So a positive proportion of p have a between xp and yp for 0<x<y<1/2, but equidistribution in smaller sets is not known.

a(n)^2 + 1 = 2*b(n)^2, with b(n) = A001653(n), is the necessary and sufficient condition for a(n) to be a number k for which the diagonal of a 1 X k rectangle is an integer multiple of the diagonal of a 1 X 1 square. If squares are laid out thus along one diagonal of a horizontal 1 X a(n)rectangle, from the lower left corner to the upper right, the number of squares is b(n), and there will always be a square whose top corner lies exactly within the top edge of the rectangle. Numbering the squares 1 to b(n) from left to right, the number of the one square that has a corner in the top edge of the rectangle is c(n) = (2*b(n) - a(n) + 1)/2, which is A055997(n). The horizontal component of the corner of the square in the edge of the rectangle is also an integer, namely d(n) = a(n) - b(n), which is A001542(n). - _David Pasino_, Jun 30 2016

The first positive value of Mertens's function for n > 1 is for n = 94. The graph seems to show a negative bias for the Mertens function which is eerily similar to the Chebyshev bias (described in A156749 and A156709). The purported bias seems to be empirically approximated to - (6 / Pi^2) * (sqrt(n) / 4) (by looking at the graph) (see MathOverflow link, May 28 2012) where 6 / Pi^2 = 1 / zeta(2) is the asymptotic density of squarefree numbers (the squareful numbers having Moebius mu of 0). This would be a growth pattern akin to the Chebyshev bias. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jan 23 2011

PROPERTIES: 
In other words, least m > 0 such that 2n+1 divides 2^m-1.
Number of riffle shuffles of 2n+2 cards required to return a deck to initial state. A riffle shuffle replaces a list s(1), s(2), ..., s(m) with s(1), s((i/2)+1), s(2), s((i/2)+2), ... a(1) = 2 because a riffle shuffle of [1, 2, 3, 4] requires 2 iterations [1, 2, 3, 4] -> [1, 3, 2, 4] -> [1, 2, 3, 4] to restore the original order.
Concerning the complexity of computing this sequence, see for example Bach and Shallit, p. 115, exercise 8.
It is not difficult to prove that if 2n+1 is a prime then 2n is a multiple of a(n). But the converse is not true. Indeed, one can prove that a(2^(2t-1))=4t. Thus if n=2^(2t-1), where, for any m > 0, t=2^(m-1) then 2n is a multiple of a(n) while 2n+1 is a Fermat number which, as is well known, is not always a prime. It is an interesting problem to describe all composite numbers for which 2n is divisible by a(n). - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 09 2008

From _V. Raman_, Sep 18 2012, Dec 10 2012: (Start)
If 2n+1 is prime, then the polynomial (x^(2n+1)+1)/(x+1) factors into 2n/a(n) polynomials of the same degree a(n) over GF(2).
If (x^(2n+1)+1)/(x+1) is irreducible over GF(2), then 2n+1 is prime, and 2 is a primitive root (mod 2n+1) (cf. A001122).
For all n > 0, a(n) is the degree of the largest irreducible polynomial factor for the polynomial (x^(2n+1)+1)/(x+1) over GF(2). (End)
a(n) is a factor of phi(2n+1) (A000010(2n+1)). - _Douglas Boffey_, Oct 21 2013
Conjecture: if p is an odd prime then a((p^3-1)/2) = p * a((p^2-1)/2). Because otherwise a((p^3-1)/2) < p * a((p^2-1)/2) iff a((p^3-1)/2) = a((p-1)/2) for a prime p. Equivalently p^3 divides 2^(p-1)-1, but no such prime p is known. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Feb 10 2014

PROPERTIES: 
The weak form of this conjecture was proved by Helfgott (see link below). - _T. D. Noe_, May 14 2013
Goldbach conjectured in 1742 that for n >= 3, this sequence never vanishes. This is still unproved.
Number of different primes occurring when 2n is expressed as p1+q1 = ... = pk+qk where pk,qk are odd primes with pk <= qk. For example when n=5: 10 = 3+7 = 5+5, we can see 3 different primes so a(5) = 3. - _Naohiro Nomoto_, Feb 24 2002
Comments from Tomás Oliveira e Silva to Number Theory List, Feb 05 2005: With the help of Siegfied "Zig" Herzog of PSU, I was able to verify the Goldbach conjecture up to 2e17. Let 2n=p+q, with p and q prime be a Goldbach partition of 2n. In a minimal Goldbach partition p is as small as possible. The largest p of a minimal Goldbach partition found was 8443 and is needed for 2n=121005022304007026. Furthermore, the largest prime gap found was 1220-1; it occurs after the prime 80873624627234849.
Comments from Tomás Oliveira e Silva to Number Theory List, Apr 26 2007: With the help of Siegfried "Zig" Herzog, the NCSA and others, I have just finished the verification of the Goldbach conjecture up to 1e18. This took about 320 years of CPU time, including a double-check of the results up to 1e17. As expected, no counter-example to the conjecture was found. As side results, the number of twin primes up to 1e18 was also computed, as was the number of primes in each of the residue classes modulo 120. Also, the number of occurrences of each (observed) prime gap was also recorded.
For n > 2 we have a(n)=2*A002375(n)-1 if n is prime and a(n)=2*A002375(n) if n is composite. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 14 2004
For n > 2, a(n) = 2*A002375(n) - A010051(n). - _Jason Kimberley_, Aug 31 2011
a(n) = Sum_{p odd prime < 2*n} A010051(2*n - p). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 19 2011
There is an interesting similarity with square numbers: The number of divisors of n is odd iff n is square (A000290).  The number of decompositions of 2n into ordered sums of two primes (equaling the number of the unique primes in all such decompositions) is odd iff n is prime. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Feb 28 2015

Languasco proved that, where Lambda is the von Mangoldt function, and R(n) = SUM[i + j = n] Lambda(i)Lambda(j) is the counting function for the Goldbach numbers, and for N >= 2 and assume the Riemann hypothesis (RH) holds, then SUM[n = 1..N] R(n) = ((N^2)/2) - 2*SUM[rho]((N^(rho+1))/(rho*(rho+1)) + O(N * log^3 N).
If 2n is the sum of two distinct primes, then neither prime divides 2n. - Christopher Heiling, Feb 28 2017

Seven values of n need the maximum of 19 fourth powers. These form the arithmetic progression {79, 159, 239, 319, 399, 479, 559} each term being congruent to 79 mod 80. For n < 625 the available fourth powers are congruent to 1 or 16 mod 80, requiring 4*16 + 15*1 to sum to 79. However, 625 = 5^4 is congruent to 65 and 1*65 + 14*1 = 79. So for n > 625 and congruent to 79, only 15 fourth powers are needed to satisfy the mod 80 arithmetic. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 12 2017

Generalized factorials, [a.(n!)] = a(n)*a(n-1)*...*a(0) = A010790(n), with a(0) = 1 are related to A001263. - _Tom Copeland_, Sep 21 2011

From _Felix P. Muga II_, Mar 18 2014: (Start)
a(m), for m>=1, are the only positive integer values t for which the Binet-de Moivre formula for the recurrence b(n)=b(n-1)+t*b(n-2) with b(0)=0 and b(1)=1 has a root of a square. PROOF (as suggested by _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 26 2014): The sqrt(1+4t) appearing in the zeros r1 and r2 of the characteristic equation is (a positive) integer for positive integer t precisely if 4t+1=(2m+1)^2, that is t=a(m), m>=1. Thus, the characteristic roots are integers: r1=m+1 and r2=-m.
Let m>1 be an integer. If b(n) = b(n-1) + a(m)*b(n-2), n>=2, b(0)=0, b(1)=1, then lim b(n+1)/b(n) = m+1 as n approaches infinity. (End)

a(n+1) is the order of rowmotion on a poset obtained by adjoining a unique minimal (or maximal) element to a disjoint union of at least two chains of n elements. - _Nick Mayers_, Jun 01 2018
From _Juhani Heino_, Feb 05 2019: (Start)
For n > 0, 1/a(n) = n/(n+1) - (n-1)/n.
For example, 1/6 = 2/3 - 1/2; 1/12 = 3/4 - 2/3.
Corollary of this:
Take 1/2 pill.
Next day, take 1/6 pill. 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3, so your daily average is 1/3.
Next day, take 1/12 pill. 2/3 + 1/12 = 3/4, so your daily average is 1/4.
And so on. (End)

For k >= 1, log(k + 1/2) + gamma < H(k) < log(k + 1/2) + gamma + 1/(24k^2), where gamma is Euler's constant (A001620). It is likely that the upper and lower bounds have the same floor for all k >= 2, in which case a(n) = floor(exp(n-gamma) + 1/2) for all n >= 0. - _Dean Hickerson_, Apr 19 2003
This remark is based on a simple heuristic argument. The lower and upper bounds differ by 1/(24k^2), so the probability that there's an integer between the two bounds is 1/(24k^2). Summing that over all k >= 2 gives the expected number of values of k for which there's an integer between the bounds. That sum equals Pi^2/144 - 1/24 ~ 0.02687. That's much less than 1, so it is unlikely that there are any such values of k. - _Dean Hickerson_, Apr 19 2003
Referring to A118050 and A118051, using a few terms of the asymptotic series for the inverse of H(x), we can get an expression which, with greater likelihood than mentioned above, should give a(n) for all n >= 0. For example, using the same type of heuristic argument given by _Dean Hickerson_, it can be shown that, with probability > 99.995%, we should have, for all n >= 0, a(n) = floor(u + 1/2 - 1/(24u) + 3/(640u^3)) where u = e^(n - gamma). - David W. Cantrell (DWCantrell(AT)sigmaxi.net)
For k > 1, H(k) is never an integer. Hence apart from the first two terms this sequence coincides with A004080. - Nick Hobson, Nov 25 2006

a(n) is the absolute value of the constant term of the Euler polynomial E_{2n-1} times the even part of 2n. - _Peter Luschny_, Nov 26 2010
From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Aug 31 2017: (Start)
Let E_m(x) = x^m + Sum_{odd k=1..m} e_k(m)*x^(m-k) be the Euler polynomial, let 2*n-1 <= m. Show that the expression c(m,n) = |e_(2*n-1)(m)|/binomial(m,2*n-1) does not depend on m and c(m,n) = a(n)/A006519(2*n). Indeed, by the formula in the Shevelev link |e_(2*n-1)(m)| = binomial(m,2*n-1)*(4^n-1)*B_(2*n)/n. On the other hand, by Cloitre's formula, we have a(n) = (4^n-1)*|B_(2*n)|*2^A001511(n) /n. Taking into account that 2^A001511 = A006519(2*n) we obtain the claimed equality. Since sign(e_k(n)) = (-1)^((k+1)/2), we have the following application of the sequence: e_k(n) = (-1)^((k+1)/2))*a((k+1)/2)*binomial(n,k)/A006519(k+1). (End)

a(n) is the number of ordered pairs (A,B) of subsets of {1,2,...,n} such that (i.) A and B are disjoint and (ii.) A and B contain the same number of elements. For example, a(2) = 3 because we have: ({},{}) ; ({1},{2}) ; ({2},{1}). - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Sep 04 2013
Also central terms of A082601. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Apr 13 2014

a(n) is also the number of solutions to the equation x(1) + x(2) + ... + x(n) = 0, where x(1), ..., x(n) are in the set {-1,0,1}. Indeed, the terms in (1 + x + x^2)^n that produce x^n are of the form x^i(1)*x^i(2)*...*x^i(n) where i(1), i(2), ..., i(n) are in {0,1,2} and i(1) + i(2) + ... + i(n) = n. By setting j(t) = i(t) - 1 we obtain that j(1), ..., j(n) satisfy j(1) + ... + j(n) =0 and j(t) in {-1,0,1} for all t = 1..n. - _Lucien Haddad_, Mar 10 2018

a(n) is always divisible by 3 (by the von Staudt-Clausen theorem, see A002445).
A comment due to G. Campbell: The original approach taken by Euler was to derive the infinite product for sin(Pi*x)/(Pi*x) equal to (1 - x^2/1^2) (1 - x^2/2^2)(1 - x^2/3^2) ... treating sin(Pi*x)/(Pi*x) as if it were a polynomial.

Except for 0, 1 and 5, all terms are Brazilian repunits numbers in base 4, and so belong to A124134. For n >= 3, all these terms are composite because a(n) = {(2^n-1) * (2^n +1)}/3 and either (2^n - 1) or (2^n +1) is a multiple of 3. - _Bernard Schott_, Apr 29 2017

a(n) (n>=1) is the viabin number of the integer partition [n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2,1] (for the definition of viabin number see comment in A290253). Example: a(4) = 85 = 1010101_2; consequently, the southeast border of the Ferrers board of the corresponding integer partition is ENENENEN, where E = (1,0), N = (0,1); this leads to the integer partition [4,3,2,1]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 30 2017

Let A be the Hessenberg matrix of order n, defined by: A[1,j]=1, A[i,i]:=10, (i>1), A[i,i-1]=-1, and A[i,j]=0 otherwise. Then, for n >= 2, a(n-1) = (-1)^n*charpoly(A,1). - _Milan Janjic_, Feb 21 2010
From _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 30 2013: (Start)
Least index k such that A052382(k) >= 10^(n-1), for n > 0.
Also index k such that A052382(k) = (10^n-1)/9, n > 0.
A052382(a(n)) is the least zerofree number with n digits, for n > 0.
For n > 1: A052382(a(n)-1) is the greatest zerofree number with n-1 digits. (End)
For n > 0, 4*a(n) is the total number of holes in a certain triangle fractal (start with 9 triangles, 4 holes) after n iterations. See illustration in links. - _Kival Ngaokrajang_, Feb 21 2015
For n > 0, a(n) is the sum of the numerators and denominators of the reduced fractions 0 < (b/3^(n-1)) < 1 plus 1. Example for n=3 gives fractions 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 4/9, 5/9, 2/3, 7/9, and 8/9 plus 1 has sum of numerators and denominators +1 = a(3) = 91. - _J. M. Bergot_, Jul 11 2015
Except for 0 and 1, all terms are Brazilian repunits numbers in base 9, so belong to A125134. All these terms are composite because a(n) is the ((3^n - 1)/2)-th triangular number. - _Bernard Schott_, Apr 23 2017

PROPERTIES: 
From _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Apr 09 2012: (Start)
K. S. Lucas found, by brute-force search - using Maple programming, several different variants of integral identities which relate each of several first Pi convergents (A002485(n)/A002486(n)) to Pi.
I conjecture the following identity below, which represents a generalization of Stephen Lucas' experimentally obtained identities:
  (-1)^n*(Pi-A002485(n)/A002486(n)) = 1/abs(i)*2^j)*Integrate(x^l*(1-x)^m*(k+(k+i)*x^2)/(1+x^2),x= 0..1) where {i, j, k, l, m} are some integers (see the StackExchange link below).

It is conjectured that this sequence is infinite, but this has never been proved.
An equivalent description: primes of form P = (p1*p2*...*pm)^k + 1 where p1 ... pm are primes and k > 1, since then k must be even for P to be prime.
Also prime = p(n) if A054269(n) = 1, i.e., quotient-cycle-length = 1 in continued fraction expansion of sqrt(p). - _Labos Elemer_, Feb 21 2001
Also primes p such that phi(p) is a square.
Also primes of form x*y + z, where x, y and z are three successive numbers. - _Giovanni Teofilatto_, Jun 05 2004
It is a result that goes back to Mirsky that the set of primes p for which p-1 is squarefree has density A, where A denotes the Artin constant (A = prod_q (1-1/(q(q-1))), q running over all primes). Numerically A = 0.3739558136.... More precisely, Sum_{p <= x} mu(p-1)^2 = Ax/log x + o(x/log x) as x tends to infinity. Conjecture: Sum_{p <= x, mu(p-1)=1} 1 = (A/2)x/log x + o(x/log x) and Sum_{p <= x, mu(p-1)=-1} 1 = (A/2)x/log x + o(x/log x). - Pieter Moree (moree(AT)mpim-bonn.mpg.de), Nov 03 2003
Also primes of the form x^y + 1, where x > 0, y > 1. Primes of the form x^y - 1 (x > 0, y > 1) are the Mersenne primes listed in A000668(n) = {3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, ...}. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Mar 04 2007

An n X n nonnegative matrix A is primitive (see A070322) iff every element of A^k is > 0 for some power k. If A is primitive then the power which should have all positive entries is <= n^2 -2n +2 (Wielandt).
a(n) = Phi_4(n), where Phi_k is the k-th cyclotomic polynomial.

Also, except for the first term, numbers that cannot be expressed as a perfect power, i.e., x^2 + 1 != y^n for all x,y,n > 1. Proof: We assume the truth of the following theorem. Proofs can be found in elementary texts on number theory and online. Theorem I: A number N is a sum of two squares if and only if all prime factors of N of the form 4m+3 have even exponents.
We are now ready to prove x^2 + 1 != y^n for all x,y,n > 1. We assume equality and seek a contradiction for n even and n odd. If n is even = 2k, x^2 + 1 = y^2k = (y^k)^2 and (y^k - x)(y^k + x) = 1. This implies y^k-x = y^k+x = 1 or 2x = 0 contrary to x > 1. So n must be odd for equality to hold.
Then x^2+1 = y^(2k+1) implies all prime factors of y, including those of the form 4m+3 are raised to an odd exponent contrary to Theorem I. So we have shown x^2+1 = y^n is false for n even or n odd. Therefore x^2 + 1 != y^n as was desired. (End)
Note that in the above proof, y doesn't necessarily have any prime factors of the form 4m+3. - _Jon Perry_, Aug 06 2012

For n>=1, a(n-1) is the minimal number of choices from an n-set such that at least one particular element has been chosen at least n times or each of the n elements has been chosen at least once. Some games define "matches" this way; e.g., in the classic Parker Brothers, now Hasbro, board game Risk, a(2)=5 is the number of cards of three available types (suits) required to guarantee at least one match of three different types or of three of the same type (ignoring any jokers or wildcards). - _Rick L.

Also the limit as q->1^- of the unimodal polynomial (1-q^(n*k+1))/(1-q) after making the simplification k=n. The unimodal polynomial is from O'Hara's proof of unimodality of q-binomials after making the restriction to partitions of size <=1. See G_1(n,k) from arXiv:1711.11252. As the size restriction s increases, G_s->G_infinity=G: the q-binomials. Then substituting k=n and q=1 yields the central binomial coefficients: A000984. - _Bryan T. Ek_, Apr 11 2018

For n>=2, number of ordered partitions of n-1 into parts of sizes 1 and 2 where there are two types of 1 (singletons) and five types of 2 (twins). For example, the number of possible configurations of families of n-1 male (M) and female (F) offspring considering only single births and twins, where the birth order of M/F/pair-of-twins is considered and there are five types of twins; namely, both F (identical twins), both F (fraternal twins), both M (identical), both M (fraternal), or one F and one M - where birth order within a pair of twins itself is disregarded. In particular, for a(3)=9, two children could be either: (1) F, then M; (2) M, then F; (3) F,F; (4) M,M; (5) F,F identical twins; (6) F,F fraternal twins; (7) M,M identical twins; (8) M,M fraternal twins; or (9) M,F twins (emphasizing that birth order is irrelevant here when children are the same gender, when two children are within the same pair of twins and when pairs of twins have both the same gender(s) and identical-vs-fraternal characteristics). - _Rick L.

a(n) = number of edges in the Hasse diagram for the Bruhat order on permutations of [n+1]. - _David Callan_, Sep 03 2005
Proof. As explained on page 1 of the Stanley link, edges in the Hasse diagram of the (strong) Bruhat order on S_n are associated with pairs (pi,(i,j)) with pi in S_n and 1 <= i < j <= n, such that pi_i < pi_j and each entry of pi lying between pi_i and pi_j in POSITION does not lie between pi_i and pi_j in VALUE.
For example, pi = (3, 5, 1, 2, 4) gives edges for the (i,j) pairs (1,2), (1,5), (3,4), (4,5) but not, e.g., for (i,j) = (3,5) because 2 lies between pi_3=1 and pi_5=4 both in position and in value.
Let us count edges for a given pair (i,j). Consider the j-i+1 entries pi_i, pi_(i+1),...,pi_j. There are (j-i+1)! possible orderings for their values and (i,j) contributes an edge <=> the values of pi_i, pi_j are adjacent in this ordering with pi_i < pi_j.
There are (j-i)! such orderings (just coalesce the items pi_i, pi_j into a single item). The net result is that (i,j) contributes an edge 1/(j-i+1) of the time. So the total number of edges in the Hasse diagram is Sum_{1 <= i < j <= n} n!/(j-i+1) = (n+1)!(H_(n+1) - 2) + n! where H_n = 1+1/2+1/3+ ... +1/n is the harmonic sum.

PROPERTIES: 
A004280 gives indices of Fibonacci numbers (A000045) which are also Markoff (or Markov) numbers.
As mentioned by Conway and Guy, all odd-indexed Pell numbers (A001653) also appear in this sequence. The positions of the Fibonacci and Pell numbers in this sequence are given in A158381 and A158384, respectively. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 19 2009
Assuming that each solution (x,y,z) is ordered x <= y <= z, the open problem is to prove that each z value occurs only once. There are no counterexamples in the first 1046858 terms, which have z values < Fibonacci(5001) = 6.2763...*10^1044. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 19 2009
Zagier shows that there are C log^2 (3x) + O(log x (log log x)^2) Markoff numbers below x, for C = 0.180717.... - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 14 2010 [but see Thompson, below]
The odd numbers in this sequence are of the form 4k+1. - _Paul Muljadi_, Jan 31 2011
All prime divisors of Markov numbers (with exception 2) are of the form 4k+1. - _Artur Jasinski_, Nov 20 2011
Kaneko extends a parameterization of Markoff numbers, citing Frobenius, and relates it to a conjectured behavior of the elliptic modular j-function at real quadratic numbers. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 06 2012
Riedel (2012) claims a proof of the unicity conjecture: "it will be shown that the largest member of [a Markoff] triple determines the other two uniquely." - _Jonathan Sondow_, Aug 21 2012
There are 93 terms with each term <= 2*10^9 in the sequence. The number of distinct prime divisors of any of the first 93 terms is less than 6. The second, third, 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 11th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 24th, 25th, 27th, 30th, 36th, 38th, 45th, 48th, 49th, 69th, 79th, 81st, 86th, 91st terms are primes. - _Shanzhen Gao_, Sep 18 2013
Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak have announced a proof that almost all Markoff numbers are composite--see A256395. Equivalently, the prime Markoff numbers A178444 have density zero among all Markoff numbers. (It is conjectured that infinitely many Markoff numbers are prime.) - _Jonathan Sondow_, Apr 30 2015
According to Sarnak on Apr 30 2015, all claims to have proved the unicity conjecture have turned out to be false. - _Jonathan Sondow_, May 01 2015
The numeric value of C = lim (number of Markoff numbers < x) / log^2(3x) given in Zagier's paper and quoted above suffers from an accidentally omitted digit and rounding errors. The correct value is C = 0.180717104711806... (see A261613 for more digits). - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Aug 22 2015

For any positive real c, the mappings R(x)=(c*x)^(1/4) and S(x)=sqrt(c/x) have the same unique attractor c^(1/3), to which their iterated applications converge from any complex plane point. The present case is obtained setting c=2. It is noteworthy that in this way one can evaluate cube roots using only square roots.

Odd numbers and their squares both having the form 2x-+1, we may write (2r+1)^3 = (2r+1)*(2s-1), where s = centered squares = (r+1)^2 + r^2. Since 2r+1 = (r+1)^2 - r^2, it follows immediately from summing telescopingly over n-1, the product 2*{(r+1)^4 - r^4} - {(r+1)^2 - r^2}, that Sum_{r=0..n-1} (2r+1)^3 = 2*n^4 - n^2 = n^2*(2n^2 - 1). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jun 16 2004
a(n) is also the starting term in the sum of a number M(n) of consecutive cubed integers equaling a squared integer (A253724) for M(n) equal to twice a squared integer (A001105).

If M is twice a squared integer, there always exists at least one nontrivial solution for the sum of M consecutive cubed integers starting from a^3 and equaling a squared integer c^2. For n >= 1, M(n) = 2n^2 (A001105), a(n) = M(M-1)/2 = n^2(2n^2 - 1), and c(n) = sqrt(M/2) (M(M^2-1)/2) = n^3(4n^4 - 1).

From _Dimitri Papadopoulos_, Oct 28 2016: (Start)
The sum of the coefficients of the expansion of sqrt(1+x) is sqrt(2) (easy). The sum of the squares of the coefficients is 4/pi (observation).
If a term of this sequence is divisible by p a prime, then that term is in a block of exactly (p^k-3)/2 consecutive terms all of which are divisible by p. Furthermore, if a(n) is the term preceding such a block then a(p*n-(p-1)/2) also precedes a block of (p^(k+1)-3)/2 terms all divisible by p (observation/conjecture).
E.g a(4)=-5 is divisible by 5 and is in a block of (5^1-3)/2=1 consecutive terms that are all divisible by 5. Then a(5*3-(5-1)/2 )= a(13)=52003 precedes a block of exactly (5^2-3)/2=11 terms all divisible by 5.

This is also the order dimension of the (strong) Bruhat order on the Coxeter group A_{n-1} (the symmetric group S_n). - Nathan Reading (reading(AT)math.umn.edu), Mar 07 2002
Let M_n denote the n X n matrix m(i,j) = 2 if i = j; m(i, j) = 1 if (i+j) is even; m(i, j) = 0 if i + j is odd, then a(n+2) = det M_n. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Jun 19 2002

Also, from the starting position in standard chess, minimum number of captures by pawns of the same color to place n of them on the same file (column). Beyond a(6), the board and number of pieces available for capture are assumed to be extended enough to accomplish this task. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Sep 17 2002
For example, a(2) = 1 and one capture can produce "doubled pawns", a(3) = 2 and two captures is sufficient to produce tripled pawns, etc. (Of course other, uncounted, non-capturing pawn moves are also necessary from the starting position in order to put three or more pawns on a given file.) - _Rick L.

a(n-1) gives number of distinct elements greater than 1 of non-symmetric partitions of n into at most 3 parts, with zeros used as padding, appear in the middle. E.g., 5 = 5 + 0 + 0 = 0 + 5 + 0 = 4 + 1 + 0 = 1 + 4 + 0 = 1 + 0 + 4 = 3 + 2 + 0 = 2 + 3 + 0 = 2 + 0 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1.

a(n) gives number of maximal strokes on complete graph K_n, when edges on K_n can be assigned directions in any way. A "stroke" is a locally maximal directed path on a directed graph. Examples: n = 3, two strokes can exist, "x -> y -> z" and " x -> z", so a(3) = 2. n = 4, four maximal strokes exist, "u -> x -> z" and "u -> y" and "u -> z" and "x -> y -> z", so a(4) = 4. - _Yasutoshi Kohmoto_, Dec 20 2003

PROPERTIES: 
These coefficients (with alternating signs) are also known as the Nørlund [or Norlund, Noerlund or Nörlund] numbers.
The denominators are found in A002790. The alternating rational sequence ((-1)^n)*a(n)/A002790(n)is the z-sequence for the Stirling2 triangle A008277(n+1,k+1), n>=k>=0. This is the Sheffer (exp(x),exp(x)-1) triangle. See the W. Lang link under A006232 for Sheffer a- and z-sequences with references, and the conversion to S. Roman's notation. The a-sequence is A006232(n)/A006233(n). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 06 2011 [This is the Sheffer triangle A007318*A048993. Added Jun 20 2017]

Comment from _Marc LeBrun_: Maximum possible number of distinct new values after applying a commuting operation N times to a single initial value.
Divide the natural numbers in sets of consecutive numbers, starting with {1}, each set with number of elements equal to the sum of elements of the preceding set. The number of elements in the n-th (n>0) set gives a(n). The sets begin {1}, {2}, {3,4}, {5,6,7,8,9,10,11}, ... - _Floor van Lamoen_, Jan 16 2002
Consider the free algebraic system with one binary commutative (x+y) operator and one generator A. The number of elements of height n is a(n) where the height of A is zero and the height of (x+y) is one more than the maximum height of x and y. - _Michael Somos_, Mar 06 2012
Sergey Zimnitskiy, May 08 2013, provided an illustration for A006894 and A002658 in terms of packing circles inside circles. The following description of the figure was supplied by _Allan Wilks_. Label a blank page "1" and draw a black circle labeled "2". Subsequent circles are labeled "3", "4", ... . In the black circle put two red circles (numbered "3" and "4"); two because the label of the black circle is "2". Then in each of the red circles put blue circles in number equal to the labels of the red circles. So these get labeled "5", ..., "11". Then in each of the blue circles, starting with circle "5", place a set of green (say) circles, equal in number to the label of the enclosing blue circle. When all of the green circles have been drawn, they will be labeled "12", ..., "67". If you take the maximum circle label at each colored level, you get 1,2,4,11,67,2279,..., which is A006894, which itself is the partial sums of A002658. The picture is a visualization of _Floor van Lamoen_'s comment above.

Let [n] denote the set {1,2,3,...,n} and denote an n-permutation of the elements of [n] by p = p(1)p(2)p(3)...p(n), where p(i) is the i-th entry in the linear order given by p. Then (p(i),p(j)) is an inversion of p if i < j but p(i) > p(j). Denote the number of inversions of p by inv(p) and call a 2n-permutation p = p(1)p(2)...p(2n) 2-ordered if p(1) < p(3) < ... < p(2n-1) and p(2) < p(4) < ... < p(2n).

From Pab Ter (pabrlos2(AT)yahoo.com), Jan 24 2006: (Start)
The number of equivalence classes of sequences of period p, taking values in a set with b elements, is given by:
N(p) = 1/(p*phi(p)) Sum_{t=0..p-1} Sum_{k=1..p-1 & gcd(p,k)=1} b^C(k,t) where C(k,t), the number of disjoint cycles of the permutations considered, is C(k,t) = Sum_{u=0..p-1} 1/M(k,p/gcd(p,u(k-1)+t)).
If gcd(k,L)=1, M(k,L) denotes the least positive integer M such that 1+k+..+k^(M-1) == 0 (mod L). Also if gcd(k,L)=1 and Ek(L) denotes the exponent of k mod L: M(k,L)=L*Ek(L)/gcd(L,1+k+..+k^(Ek(L)-1)).
(End)
Number of two-colored necklaces of length n, where similar necklaces are counted only once. Two necklaces of length n, given by color functions c and d from {0, ..., n-1} to N (set of natural numbers) are considered similar iff there is a factor f, 0 < f < n, satisfying gcd(f,n) = 1, such that, for all k from {0, ..., n-1}, d(f * k mod n) = c(k). I.e., the bead at position k is moved to f * k mod n. In other words: the sequence counts the orbits of the action of the multiplicative group {f | 0 < f < n, gcd(f,n) = 1} on the set of two-colored necklaces where f maps c to d with the formula above. - _Matthias Engelhardt_
Counts the same necklaces as A000029 but some of the necklaces viewed as distinct in A000029 are now viewed as equal. In particular, this implies that a(n) <= A000029(n) for every n.

Contribution from Wolfdieter Lang, Feb 27 2012 (Start):
The corresponding primes (n^2+1)/10  are given in A207337(n).
a(n) is the smallest positive representative of the class of nontrivial solutions of the congruence x^2==1 (Modd A207337(n)), if n>=2. The trivial solution is the class with representative x=1, which also includes -1.  For Modd n see a comment on A203571. For n=1: a(1) =7 ==3 (Modd 5), and 3 is the smallest positive solution >1.
The unique class of nontrivial solutions of the congruence x^2==1 (Modd p), with p an odd prime, exists for any p of the form 4*k+1, given in A002144. Here a subset of these primes is covered, the ones for k=k(n)=(a(n)^2-9)/40. These k-values are [1, 4, 7, 13, 18, 27, 34, 70, 99, 112,...].

a(8)=2201 is the only known non-palindromic rootnumber.
There are no further non-palindromic terms (other than 2201) up to 10^11. - _Matevz Markovic_, Apr 04 2011. There are none up to 10^15, by direct search. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 16 2011
There are no non-palindromic terms in the range 10^15 to 10^20 with digits from the set {0,1,2}. - _Hans Havermann_, May 18 2011.
From _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 23 2011: (Start)
Using the table by Noe-De Geest, I noticed that all numbers {a(n)=A002780(n);  11<=a(n)<=10^17+10^16+11}, except 2201, allow a partition into 3 disjoint classes of terms of the following forms: 10^k+1, 10^(2*k)+10^k+1, and (10^u+1)*(10^v+1).
Does there exist a term a(n)>10^17+10^16+11 which is in none of these classes?
If there is no such term, then we conclude that the sum of digits of a(n) does not exceed 4 (more exactly, it is i+1 where i is the number of class).
One can prove that the sequence contains no term (other than 2201) with sum of digits = 5. (End)

PROPERTIES: 
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 12 2011: (Start)
r(n) = a(n+1)*(-1)^n, n >= 0, gives the alternating row sums of the coefficient triangle A199577, i.e., r(n)=La_n(1;0,-1), with the monic first associated Laguerre polynomials with parameter alpha=0 evaluated at x=-1.
The e.g.f. for these row sums r(n) is g(x) = -(2+x)*exp(1/(1+x))*(Ei(1,1/(1+x))-Ei(1,1))/(1+x)^3 + 1/(1+x)^2, with the exponential integral Ei(1,x) = GAMMA(0,x).
This e.g.f. satisfies the homogeneous ordinary second-order differential equation (1+x)^2*(d^2/dx^2)g(x) + (6+5*x)*(d/dx)g(x) + 4*g(x) = 0, g(0)=1, (d/dx)g(x)|_{x=0}=-4.
This e.g.f. g(x) is equivalent to the recurrence
  b(n)= -2*(n+1)*b(n-1) - n^2*b(n-2), b(-1)=0, b(0)=1.
Therefore, the e.g.f. of a(n) is A(x)=int(g(-x),x), with A(0)=0. This agrees with the e.g.f. given below in the formula section by _Max Alekseyev_.

PROPERTIES: 
g(n) is the smallest number s such that every natural number is the sum of at most s n-th powers of natural numbers.
It is known (Kubina and Wunderlich, 1990) that g(n) = 2^n + floor((3/2)^n) - 2 for all n <= 471600000. This formula is conjectured to be correct for all n (see A174420).
Mahler showed that there are only finitely many n's for which this formula fails. - _Tomohiro Yamada_, Sep 23 2017
This sequence (which corresponds to Waring's original conjecture) is much easier to compute than A079611, the problem of finding the minimal s = G(n) for almost all (= sufficienly large) integers. See Wikipedia for a one-line proof that this value for g(n), conjectured by J. A. Euler in 1772, is indeed a lower bound; it is known to be tight if 2^n*frac((3/2)^n) + floor((3/2)^n) <= 2^n, and no counter-example to this inequality is known. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 29 2014

PROPERTIES: 
H(n) is the maximal distance that a stack of n cards can project beyond the edge of a table without toppling.
If n is not in {1, 2, 6} then a(n) has at least one prime factor other than 2 or 5. E.g., a(5) = 60 has a prime factor 3 and a(7) = 140 has a prime factor 7. This implies that every H(n) = A001008(n)/A002805(n), n not from {1, 2, 6}, has an infinite decimal representation. For a proof see the J. Havil reference. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 29 2007
a(n) = A213999(n,n-1). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jul 03 2012
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 16 2015: (Start)
a(n)/A001008(n) = 1/H(n) is the solution of the following version of the classical cistern and pipes problem. A cistern is connected to n different pipes of water. For the k-th pipe it takes k time units (say, days) to fill the empty cistern, for k = 1, 2, ..., n. How long does it take for the n pipes together to fill the empty cistern? 1/H(n) gives the fraction of a the time unit as answer.
In general, if the k-th pipe needs d(k) days to fill the empty cistern then all pipes together need 1/sum(1/d(k),k = 1..n) =  HM(d(1), ..., d(n))/n days, where HM denotes the harmonic mean HM. For the described problem, HM(1, 2, ..., n)/n = A102928(n)/(n*A175441(n)) = 1/H(n).
For a classical cistern and pipes problem see, e.g., the Hunger-Vogel reference (in Greek and German) given in A256101, problem 27, p. 29, where n = 3, and d(1), d(2) and d(3) are 6, 4 and 3 days. 0n p. 97 of this reference one finds remarks on the history of such problems (called in German 'Brunnenaufgabe').(End)
From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 17 2015: (Start)
An example of the above mentioned cistern and pipes problems appears in Chiu Chang Suan Shu (nine books on arithmetic) in book VI, problem 26. The numbers are there 1/2, 1, 5/2, 3 and 5 (days) and the result is 15/75 (day). See the reference (in German) on p. 68.
A historical account on such cistern problems is found in the Johannes Tropfke reference, given in A256101, section 4.2.1.2 Zisternenprobleme (Leistungsprobleme), pp. 578-579.
In Fibonacci's Liber Abaci such problems appear on p. 281 and p. 284 of L. E. Sigler's translation. (End)

The natural numbers 1,2,... are divided into three sets: 1 (the unit), the primes (A000040) and the composite numbers (A002808).
The number of composite numbers <= n (A065855) = n - pi(n) (A000720) - 1.
n is composite iff sigma(n) + phi(n) > 2n. This is a nice result of the well known theorem: For all positive integers n, n = Sum_{d|n} phi(d). For the proof see my contribution to puzzle 76 of Carlos Rivera's Primepuzzles. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 27 2005, Jan 18 2015

Composite numbers n which are the product of r=A001222(n) prime numbers are sometimes called r-almost primes. Sequences listing r-almost primes are: A000040 (r = 1), A001358 (r = 2), A014612 (r = 3), A014613 (r = 4), A014614 (r = 5), A046306 (r = 6), A046308 (r = 7), A046310 (r = 8), A046312 (r = 9), A046314 (r = 10), A069272 (r = 11), A069273 (r = 12), A069274 (r = 13), A069275 (r = 14), A069276 (r = 15), A069277 (r = 16), A069278 (r = 17), A069279 (r = 18), A069280 (r = 19), A069281 (r = 20). - _Jason Kimberley_, Oct 02 2011

An integer is composite if and only if it is the sum of strictly positive integers in arithmetic progression with common difference 2: 4 = 1 + 3, 6 = 2 + 4, 8 = 3 + 5, 9 = 1 + 3 + 5, etc. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 02 2014

For n > 4, these are numbers n such that n!/n^2 = (n-1)!/n is an integer (see A056653). - _Derek Orr_, Apr 16 2015
Let f(x) = Sum_{i=1..x} Sum_{j=2..i-1} cos((2*Pi*x*j)/i). It is known that the zeros of f(x) are the prime numbers. So these are the numbers n such that f(n) > 0. - _Michel Lagneau_, Oct 13 2015
Numbers n that can be written as solutions of the Diophantine equation n = (x+2)(y+2) where {x,y} in N^2, pairs of natural numbers including zero (cf. Mathematica code and Davis). - _Ron R Spencer_ and _Bradley Klee_, Aug 15 2016
Numbers n with a partition (containing at least two summands) so that its summands also multiply to n. If n is prime, there is no way to find those two (or more) summands. If n is composite, simply take a factor or several, write those divisors and fill with enough 1's so that they add up to n. For example: 4 = 2*2 = 2+2, 6 = 1*2*3 = 1+2+3, 8 = 1*1*2*4 = 1+1+2+4, 9 = 1*1*1*3*3 = 1+1+1+3+3. - _Juhani Heino_, Aug 02 2017

This sequence uses UK English as opposed to US English. a(6) = 107 since "one hundred and seven" has six syllables. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2009
Because of this convention, we do not have A075774(a(n))=n, since A075774 uses US English, i.e., without the "trailing 'and'". All terms from a(6)=107 on will have this 'and', therefore A075774(a(n)) = n-1 for 5 < n < 18. From a(18)=107777 on, there is a second 'and', etc. See A045736 for the "American English" version, see A001167 for the analog considering the number of words. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2013
From _Bernard Schott_, Feb 18 2019: (Start)
a(19) = 111777 is precisely the number used for Berry's paradox. The name in UK English of the number 111777 requires 19 syllables because its name is: "One hundred and eleven thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven" and it's exactly the smallest number containing 19 syllables in UK English.
The paradox occurs when we know that this integer is "the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables" but, however, 111777 has just been now defined in eighteen syllables with this last sentence. So, there is a contradiction, because the smallest integer expressible in nineteen syllables can be expressed in eighteen syllables. This contradiction is Berry's paradox. (End)

Also numerators of the convergents to the square root of 3 using the following recursion for initial x = 1: x1=x, x=3/x, x=(x+x1)/2.
This recursion was derived by experimenting with polynomial recursions of the form x = -a(0)/(a(n-1)x^(n-1)+...+a(1)) in an effort to find a root for the polynomial a(n)x^n+a(n-1)x^(n-1)+...+a(0). The process was hit and miss until I introduced the averaging step described above. This method is equivalent to Newton's Method although derived somewhat differently. (End)

From _Peter Bala_, Nov 2012: (Start)
The present sequence corresponds to the case x = 2 of the following general remarks. Let x > 1 and let alpha := {x + sqrt(x^2 - 1)}. Define a sequence a(n) (which depends on x) by setting a(n) = 1/2*{alpha^(2^n) + (1/alpha)^(2^n)} for n >= 0. It is easy to verify that a(n) is a solution to the recurrence equation a(n+1) = 2*a(n)^2 - 1 with the initial condition a(0) = x.
The following algebraic identity is valid for x > 1:
sqrt(4*x^2 - 4)/(2*x + 1) = (1 - 1/(2*x))*sqrt(4*y^2 - 4)/(2*y + 1), where y = 2*x^2 - 1. Iterating the identity yields the product expansion sqrt(4*x^2 - 4)/(2*x + 1) = product {n = 0..inf} (1 - 1/(2*a(n))). A second expansion is product {n = 0..inf} (1 + 1/a(n)) = sqrt((x + 1)/(x - 1)).

From Peter Bala, Nov 22 2012: (Start)
The present sequence is the case x = 1 of the following general remarks about the recurrence a(n+1) = a(n)^3 - 3*a(n-1)^2 + 3. Cf. A002814.
Define a sequence of polynomials P(n,x) inductively by setting P(0,x) = x^2 + 3 and P(n+1,x) = P(n,x^3 + 3*x) for n >= 0. Then P(n,x) satisfies the cubic recurrence P(n+1,x) = P(n,x)^3 - 3*P(n-1,x)^2 + 3 with the initial condition P(0,x) = x^2 + 3.
An explicit formula is P(n,x) = Q(3^(n+1),x)/Q(3^n,x), where Q(n,x) = ((x + sqrt(x^2 + 4))/2)^n + ((x - sqrt(x^2 + 4))/2)^n.
Alternatively, P(n,x) = ((x^2 + 2 + sqrt(x^4 + 4*x^2))/2)^(3^n) + ((x^2 + 2 - sqrt(x^4 + 4*x^2))/2)^(3^n) + 1.
Iterating the algebraic identity x/sqrt(x^2 + 4) = (1 - 2/(x^2 + 3))*y/sqrt(y^2 + 4), where y = x^3 + 3*x, leads to the product expansion x/sqrt(x^2 + 4) = product {n = 0..inf} (1 - 2/P(n,x)). See Escott and also Fine.
The sequence A(n,x) := x*product {k = 0..n} P(k,x) satisfies the recurrence A(n+1,x) = A(n,x)^3 + 3*A(n,x). These sequences occur in the continued cotangent expansions of Lehmer. Cases currently in the database are A006267 (x = 1), A006266 (x = 2), A006268 (x = 3), A006269 (x = 5) and A145180 through A145189 (x = 6 through x = 15).

From _Peter Bala_, Nov 15 2012: (Start)
The present sequence is the case x = 3 of the following general remarks. The recurrence equation a(n+1) = a(n)^3 + 3*a(n)^2 - 3 with the initial condition a(1) = x - 1 > 1 has the explicit solution a(n+1) = alpha^(3^n) + (1/alpha)^(3^n) - 1 for n >= 0, where alpha := {x + sqrt(x^2 - 4)}/2.
Two other recurrences satisfied by the sequence are a(n+1) = (a(1) + 3)*(Product_{k = 1..n} a(k)^2) - 3 and a(n+1) = 1 + (a(1) - 1)*Product_{k = 1..n} (a(k) + 2)^2, both with a(1) = x - 1.
The associated sequence b(n) := a(n) + 1 satisfies the recurrence equation b(n+1) = b(n)^3 - 3*b(n) with the initial condition b(1) = x. See A001999 for the case x = 3. The sequence c(n) := a(n) + 2 satisfies the recurrence equation c(n+1) = c(n)^3 - 3*c(n)^2 + 3 with the initial condition c(1) = x + 1.
The sequences a(n) and b(n) have been considered by Fine and Escott in connection with a product expansion for quadratic irrationals. We have the following identity, valid for x > 2: sqrt((x + 2)/(x - 2)) = (1 + 2/(x-1))*sqrt((y + 2)/(y - 2)), where y = x^3 - 3*x or, equivalently, y - 1 = (x - 1)^3 + 3*(x - 1)^2 - 3. Iterating the identity produces the product expansion sqrt((x+2)/(x-2)) = Product_{n >= 1} (1 + 2/a(n)), with a(1) = x - 1 and a(n+1) = a(n)^3 + 3*a(n)^2 - 3.

From _Bob Selcoe_, Nov 28 2014: (Start)
Except for a(1)=1, all numbers in this sequence are congruent to (0, 2 or 3) mod 5.
It appears that when a(n)=6j, then j is also in the sequence (e.g., 138 = 6*23; 312 = 6*52).  This also appears to hold for sequence A191626. If true, then it suggests that when seeking large twin primes, good candidates might be 36*a(n) +- 1, n>=2.
Conjecture: There is at least one number in the sequence in the interval [5k, 7k] inclusive, k>=1. If true, then the twin prime conjecture also is true.
(End)
A counterexample to "It appears that ...": Take j = 63. Then 6j = 378 and 36j = 2268. Now 379, 2267, and 2269 are prime, but 377 = 13 * 29. The sequence of counter-examples is A263282. - _Jason Kimberley_, Oct 13 2015
Dinculescu calls all terms in the sequence "twin ranks", and all other positive integers "non-ranks", see links. Non-ranks are given by the formula np +- [p/6] for natural n and prime p>4, while twin ranks (this sequence) cannot be represented as np +- [p/6] for any n, p>4. Here [p/6] is the nearest integer to p/6. - _Alexei Kourbatov_, Jan 03 2015

Also called Eulerian graphs of strength 1.
"Switching" at a node complements all the edges incident with that node. The illustration (see link) shows the 3 switching classes on 4 nodes. Switching at any node is the equivalence relation.
A graph is an Euler graph iff every node has even degree. It need not be connected. (Note that some graph theorists require an Euler graph to be connected so it has an Euler circuit, and call these graphs "even" graphs.)
The objects being counted in this sequence are unlabeled.

PROPERTIES: 
Ulam conjectured that this sequence has density 0. However, calculations up to 6.759*10^8 (_Jud McCranie_) indicate that the density hovers near 0.074.
A plot of the first 3 million terms shows that they lie very close to the straight line 13.51*n, so even if we cannot prove it, we believe we now know how this sequence grows (see the plots in the links below). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 27 2006
After a few initial terms, the sequence settles into a regular pattern of dense clumps separated by sparse gaps, with period 21.601584+. This pattern continues up to at least a(n) = 5*10^6. (This comment is just a qualitative statement about the wavelike distribution of Ulam numbers, not meant to imply that every period includes Ulam numbers.) - _David W. Wilson_
_Don Knuth_ (Sep 26 2006) remarks that a(4952)=64420 and a(4953)=64682 (a gap of more than ten "dense clumps"); and there is a gap of 315 between a(18857) and a(18858).
1,2,3,47 are the only values of x < 6.759*10^8 such that x and x+1 are both Ulam numbers. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 08 2001.  This holds through the first 28 billion Ulam numbers - _Jud McCranie_, Jan 07 2016.
From _Jud McCranie_ on _David W. Wilson_'s illustration, Jun 20 2008: (Start)
The integers are shown from left to right, top to bottom, with a dot where there is an Ulam number. I think his plot is 216 wide. The local density of Ulam numbers goes in waves with a period of 21.6+, so his plot shows ten cycles.
When they are arranged that way you can see the waves. The crests of the density waves don't always have Ulam numbers there but the troughs are practically void of Ulam numbers. I noticed that the ratio of that period (21.6+) to the frequency of Ulam numbers (1 in 13.52) is very close to 8/5. (End)

a(n) is the number of sets of n disjoint pairs of 2n things, called a pairing, disjoint with a given pairing ( A053871, ) that are unique under permutations preserving the given pairing.
Can be seen immediately from a graphical representation which must decompose into even numbered cycles of 4 or more things, as connected by pairs alternating between the pairings. Each thing is in a single cycle, so this is a partition of 2n into even parts greater than 2, equivalent to a partition of n into parts greater than 1. (End)

Number of ways to arrange n books on consecutive bookshelves.
To derive a(n) = n!2^(n-1), we note that there are n! ways to arrange the books in a row. Then there are 2^(n-1) ways to place the arranged books on consecutive shelves since there are 2^(n-1) ordered partitions of n. Hence a(n) = n!2^(n-1).
Also, a(n) is the number of ways to stack n different alphabet blocks in contiguous stacks.
Furthermore, a(n) is the number of labeled, rooted forests that have (i) each root labeled larger than any nonroot, (ii) each root having exactly one child node, (iii) n non-root nodes, and (iv) each node in the forest with at most one child node.
Example: a(3)=24 since there are 24 arrangements of books b1, b2, and b3 on consecutive shelves, namely, |b1 b2 b3|, |b1 b3 b2|, |b2 b1 b3|, |b2 b3 b1|, |b3 b1 b2|, |b3 b2 b1|, |b1 b2||b3|, |b2 b1| |b3|, |b1 b3||b2|, |b3 b1||b2|, |b2 b3||b1|, |b3 b2||b1|, |b1||b2 b3|,|b1||b3 b2|, |b2||b1 b3|, |b2||b3 b1|, |b3||b1 b2|, |b3||b2 b1|, |b1||b2||b3|, |b1||b3||b2|, |b2||b1||b3|, |b2||b3||b1|, |b3||b1||b2|, and |b3||b2||b1|.

From _R. H. Hardin_, Feb 03 2016 and _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 18 2016: (Start)
Also, number of 2 X (2n) arrays of permutations of 2n copies of 0 or 1 with row sums equal.
For example, some solutions for n=3:
  0 1 0 1 0 1   0 1 0 1 1 0   0 0 1 0 1 1   1 1 1 0 0 0
  1 0 0 0 1 1   1 1 0 1 0 0   0 0 0 1 1 1   0 0 1 1 0 1
There is a simple combinatorial argument to show that this is a(n): We have 2n copies of 0's and 1's and need equal row sums. Therefore there must be n 1's in each of the two rows. Otherwise there are no constraints, so there are C(2n,n) ways of placing the 1's in the first row and independently C(2n,n) ways of placing the 1's in the second. The product is clearly C(2n,n)^2.

From _Peter Bala_, Jan 26 2018: (Start)
Let S = {[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,1]} be a set of four column vectors. Then a(n) equals the number of 3 X k arrays whose columns belong to the set S and whose row sums are all equal to n (apply Eger, Theorem 3). An example is given below. Equivalently, a(n) equals the number of lattice paths from (0,0,0) to (n,n,n) using steps (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,1) and (0,1,1).
The o.g.f. for the sequence equals the diagonal of the rational function 1/(1 - (x + y + x*z + y*z)).

NAME: From _Peter Bala_, Oct 02 2013: (Start)
SEQUENCE: 3,3,7,4,2,30,1,8,3,1,1,1,9,2,2,1,3,22986,2,1,32,8,2,1,8,55,1,5,2,28,1,5,1,1501790,1,2,1,7,6,1,1,5,2,1,6,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,3,1,2,4,3,1,35657An exotic continued fraction (for the real root of x^3 - 8*x - 10).
PROPERTIES: 
A theorem of Kuzmin in the measure theory of continued fractions says that for a random real number alpha, the probability that some given partial quotient of alpha is equal to a positive integer k is given by 1/log(2)*( log(1 + 1/k) - log(1 + 1/(k+1)) ). For example, almost all real numbers have 41.5% of their partial quotients equal to 1, 17% equal to 2, 9.3% equal to 3 and so on. Thus large partial quotients are the exception in continued fraction expansions.
Let now alpha denote the real root of Brillhart's cubic equation x^3 - 8*x - 10 = 0. Then alpha = (5 + 1/9*sqrt(3*163))^(1/3) + (5 - 1/9*sqrt(3*163))^(1/3) = 3.31862 82177 50185 65910 .... The continued fraction expansion of alpha is unusual in that there are 8 surprisingly large partial quotients in the first 200 terms, namely [22986, 1501790, 35657, 49405, 53460, 16467250, 48120, 325927]. The explanation for this behavior was given by Stark.
Roberts, p. 227, gives a remarkable product representation for beta := 2 + alpha, namely, beta = q^(1/24)*( product {n >= 1} (1 + (1/q)^(2*n+1)) ), where q = exp(Pi*sqrt(163)), and notes that the first factor exp(Pi/24*sqrt(163)) = 5.31862 82177 50185 63885 ... gives 16 decimal places of beta. Cf. A160514.
Some powers beta^k of beta share with beta the property of having exceptionally large partial quotients early on in their continued fraction expansion. Particularly noteworthy is beta^2, which, like beta, has 8 large partial quotients [126425, 8259853, 1620, 271730, 294038, 90569882, 264667, 1792603] in its first 200 terms. Strangely, apart from the third term 1620, these numbers are almost exactly 5.5 times larger than the corresponding large partial quotients [22986, 1501790, 35657, 49405, 53460, 16467250, 48120, 325927] occurring in the continued fraction expansion of beta.
Also noteworthy is beta^8 = 640320.00000000062437..., very nearly an integer, whose continued fraction expansion begins [640320, 1601600400, 320160, 2135467200, 261949, 10, 1, 20533337, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1369, 2, 2, 14, 3, 9535605, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, ...].
The cubic irrationals r*beta, where r is rational, also appear to have large partial quotients early on in their continued fraction expansions, which appear to be related to the partial quotients of beta. For example, 2/3*beta has 8 exceptionally large partial quotients [137919, 9010749, 213951, 296433, 320769, 98803508, 288729, 1955567] in the first 200 terms of its continued fraction expansion and each of these partial quotients is almost exactly 6 times larger than the corresponding large partial quotient in the expansion of beta.

PROPERTIES: 
A rooted trimmed tree is a tree without limbs of length >= 2. Limbs are the paths from the leafs (towards the root) to the nearest branching point (with the root considered to be a branching point). [clarified by _Joerg Arndt_, Mar 03 2015]
A rooted tree with a forbidden limb of length k is a rooted tree where the path from any leaf inward hits a branching node or the root within k steps.
Also counts the unordered rooted trees without "x x" in the level sequence for the pre-order walk. The bijection transforms the two outmost nodes in all limbs of lengths >= 2 into V-shaped subtrees. - _Joerg Arndt_, Mar 03 2015

"Add" (meaning here to add the numerators and add the denominators, not to add the fractions) 1/0 to 1/1 to make the fraction bigger: 2/1. Now 2/1 is too big, so add 1/1 to make the fraction smaller: 3/2, 4/3. Now 4/3 is too small, so add 3/2 to make the fraction bigger: 7/5, 10/7, ... Because the continued fraction for sqrt(2) is all 2s, it will always take exactly two terms here to switch from a number that's bigger than sqrt(2) to one that's less.

PROPERTIES: 
Definition, based on Math. Review MR0297583: By a solid partition of n is meant a 3-dimensional arrangement of positive integers N(x,y,z) satisfying the conditions (i) the integer N(x,y,z) is located at the point with Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z); N(x,y,z) is defined only for certain integers x,y,z >= 0, and (ii) if N(x,y,z) is defined and 0 <= x' <= x, 0 <= y' <= y, 0 <= z' <= z then N(x,y,z) is defined and N(x',y',z') <= N(x,y,z).  A solid partition is said to correspond to an (ordinary) partition of n=n_1+n_2+...+n_t, n_k>0, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the summands n_k and the points (x_k,y_k,z_k) for which N is defined so that n_k=N(x_k,y_k,z_k). Finally, a restricted solid partition is a solid partition such that x'<=x, y'<=y, z'<=z and N(x',y',z')=N(x,y,z) implies x'=x, y'=y, z'=z.

n is composite and squarefree and for p prime, p|n => p-1|n-1.
An odd composite number n is a pseudoprime to base a iff a^(n-1) == 1 mod n. A Carmichael number is an odd composite number n which is a pseudoprime to base a for every number a prime to n.
A composite odd number n is a Carmichael number if and only if n is squarefree and p-1 divides n-1 for every prime p dividing n. (Korselt, 1899)

Composite numbers n such that p^n == p (mod n) for every prime p <= A285512(n). - _Max Alekseyev_ and _Thomas Ordowski_, Apr 20 2017
If a composite m < A285549(n) and p^m == p (mod m) for every prime p <= prime(n), then m is a Carmichael number. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Apr 23 2017
The sequence of all Carmichael numbers can be defined as follows: a(1) = 561, a(n+1) = smallest composite k > a(n) such that p^k == p (mod k) for every prime p <= n+2. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Apr 24 2017
An integer m > 1 is a Carmichael number if and only if m is squarefree and each of its prime divisors p satisfies both s_p(m) >= p and s_p(m) == 1 (mod p-1), where s_p(m) is the sum of the base p digits of m. Then m is odd and has at least three prime factors, each < sqrt(m). See Kellner and Sondow 2019. - _Bernd C. Kellner_ and _Jonathan Sondow_, Mar 03 2019
